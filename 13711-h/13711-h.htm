    <h2>WOMEN AND LITERATURE IN FRANCE.</h2>

    <p>From a sprightly letter from Paris to the <i>Cologne
    Gazette</i>, we translate for <i>The International</i> the
    following account of the position of women in the French
    Republic, together with the accompanying gossip concerning
    sundry ladies whose names have long been quite prominently
    before the public:</p>

    <p>"It is curious that the idea of the emancipation of women
    should have originated in France, for there is no country in
    Europe where the sex have so little reason to complain of their
    position as in this, especially at Paris. Leaving out of view a
    certain paragraph of the <i>Code Civile</i>&mdash;and that is
    nothing but a sentence in a law-book&mdash;and looking closely
    into the features of women's life, we see that they are not
    only queens who reign, but also ministers who govern.</p>

    <p>"In France women are engaged in a large proportion of civil
    employments, and may without hesitation devote themselves to
    art and science. It is indeed astonishing to behold the
    interest with which the beautiful sex here enter upon all
    branches of art and knowledge.</p>

    <p>"The ateliers of the painters number quite as many female as
    male students, and there are apparently more women than men who
    copy the pictures in the Louvre. Nothing is more pleasing than
    to see these gentle creatures, with their easels, sitting
    before a colossal Rubens or a Madonna of Raphael. No difficulty
    alarms them, and prudery is not allowed to give a voice in
    their choice of subjects.</p>

    <p>"I have never yet attended a lecture, by either of the
    professors here, but I have found some seats occupied by
    ladies. Even the lectures of Michel Chevalier and Blanqui do
    not keep back the eagerness of the charming Parisians in
    pursuit of science. That Michelet and Edgar Quinet have
    numerous female disciples is accordingly not difficult to
    believe.</p>

    <p>"Go to a public session of the Academy, and you find the
    '<i>cercle</i>' filled almost exclusively by ladies, and these
    laurel-crowned heads have the delight of seeing their immortal
    works applauded by the clapping of tenderest hands. In truth,
    the French savan is uncommonly clear in the most abstract
    things; but it would be an interesting question, whether the
    necessity of being not alone easily intelligible but agreeable
    to the capacity of comprehension possessed by the unschooled
    mind of woman, has not largely contributed to the facility and
    charm which is peculiar to French scientific literature. Read
    for example the discourse on Cabanis, pronounced by Mignet at
    the last session. It would be impossible to write more
    charmingly, more elegantly, more attractively, even upon a
    subject within the range of the fine arts. The works, and
    especially the historical works, of the French, are universally
    diffused. Popular histories, so-called editions for the people,
    are here entirely unknown; everything that is published is in a
    popular edition, and if as great and various care were taken
    for the education of the people as in Germany, France would in
    this respect be the first country in the world.</p>

    <p>"With the increasing influence of monarchical ideas in
    certain circles, the women seem to be returning to the
    traditions of monarchy, and are throwing themselves into the
    business of making memoirs. Hardly have George Sand's
    Confessions been announced, and already new enterprises in the
    same line are set on foot. The European dancer, who is perhaps
    more famous for making others dance to her music, and who has
    enjoyed a monopoly of cultivated scandal, Lola Montes, also
    intends to publish her memoirs. They will of course contain an
    interesting fragment of German federal politics, and form a
    contribution to German revolutionary literature. Lola herself
    is still too beautiful to devote her own time to the writing.
    Accordingly, she has resorted to the pen of M. Balzac. If
    Madame Balzac has nothing to say against the necessary intimacy
    with the dangerous Spanish or Irish or whatever woman&mdash;for
    Lola Montes is a second Homer&mdash;the reading world may
    anticipate an interesting, chapter of life. No writer is better
    fitted for such a work than so profound a man of the world, and
    so keen a painter of character, as
    Balzac.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page194"
       id="page194"></a>[pg 194]</span>

    <p>"The well-known actress, Mlle. Georges, who was in her prime
    during the most remarkable epoch of the century, and was in
    relations with the most prominent persons of the Empire, is
    also preparing a narrative of her richly varied experiences.
    Perhaps these attractive examples may induce Madame Girardin
    also to bestow her memoirs upon us, and so the process can be
    repeated infinitely."</p>
    <hr />

    <h2>Authors and Books.</h2>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Parke Godwin has just given to the public, through Mr.
    Putnam, a new edition of the translation made by himself and
    some literary friends, of Goethe's "Autobiography, or Truth and
    Poetry from My Life." In his new preface Mr. Godwin exposes one
    of the most scandalous pieces of literary imposition that we
    have ever read of. This translation, with a few verbal
    alterations which mar its beauty and lessen its fidelity, has
    been reprinted in "Bohn's Standard Library," in London, as an
    original English version, in the making of which "the American
    was of <i>occasional use</i>," &amp;c. Mr. Godwin is one of our
    best German scholars, and his discourse last winter on the
    character and genius of Goethe, illustrated his thorough
    appreciation of the Shakspeare of the Continent, and that
    affectionate sympathy which is so necessary to the task of
    turning an author from one language into another. There are
    very few books in modern literature more attractive or more
    instructive to educated men than this Autobiography of Goethe,
    for which we are indebted to him.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>John Randolph is the best subject for a biography, that our
    political experience has yet furnished. Who that remembers the
    long and slender man of iron, with his scarcely human scorn of
    nearly all things beyond his "old Dominion," and his withering
    wit, never restrained by any pity, and his passion for
    destroying all fabrics of policy or reputation of which he was
    not himself the architect, but will read with anticipations of
    keen interest the announcement of a life of the eccentric yet
    great Virginian! Such a work, by the Hon. Hugh A. Garland, is
    in the press of the Appletons. We know little of Mr. Garland's
    capacities in this way, but if his book prove not the most
    attractive in the historical literature of the year, the fault
    will not be in its subject.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>The Scottish Booksellers have instituted a society for
    professional objects under the title of the "Edinburgh
    Booksellers' Union." In addition to business purposes, they
    propose to collect and preserve books and pamphlets written by
    or relating to booksellers, printers, engravers, or members of
    collateral professions,&mdash;rare editions of other
    works&mdash;and generally articles connected with parties
    belonging to the above professions, whether literary,
    professional, or personal.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>D'Israeli abandons himself now-a-days entirely to politics.
    "The forehead high, and gleaming eye, and lip awry, of Benjamin
    D'Israeli," sung once by <i>Fraser</i> are no longer seen
    before the title-pages of "Wondrous Tales," but only before the
    Speaker. It is much referred to, that in the recent
    parliamentary commemoration of Sir Robert Peel, the Hebrew
    commoner kept silence; his long war of bitter sarcasm and
    reproach on the defunct statesman was too freshly remembered.
    Peel rarely exerted himself to more advantage than in his
    replies, to D'Israeli, all noticeable for subdued disdain,
    conscious patriotism, and argumentative completeness. For
    injustice experienced through life, the meritorious dead are in
    a measure revenged by the feelings of their accusers or
    detractors, when the latter retain the sensibility which the
    grave usually excites, and especially amid such a chorus of
    applause from all parties, and a whole people, as we have now
    in England for Sir Robert Peel&mdash;the only man in the
    Empire, except Wellington, who had a strictly personal
    authority.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Dr. Dickson, recently of the Medical Department of the New
    York University, and whose ill-health induced the resignation
    of the chair he held there, has returned to Charleston, and we
    observe that his professional and other friends in that city
    greeted him with a public dinner, on the 9th ult. Dr. Dickson
    we believe is one of the most classically elegant writers upon
    medical science in the United States. He ranks with Chapman and
    Oliver Wendell Holmes in the grace of his periods as well as in
    the thoroughness of his learning and the exactness and
    acuteness of his logic. Like Holmes, too, he is a poet, and,
    generally, a very accomplished <i>litterateur</i>. We regret
    the loss that New York sustains in his removal, but
    congratulate Charleston upon the recovery of one of the best
    known and most loved attractions of her society.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>Mr. John R. Bartlett's boundary commission will soon be upon
    the field of its activity. We were pleased to see that Mr.
    Davis, of Massachusetts, a few days ago presented in the Senate
    petitions from Edward Everett, Jared Sparks, and others, and
    from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, at Boston, to
    the effect that it would be of great public utility to attach
    to the boundary commission to run the line between the United
    States and Mexico, a small corps of persons well qualified to
    make researches in the various departments of science.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>William C. Richards, the very clever and accomplished editor
    of the <i>Southern Literary Gazette</i> was the author of "Two
    Country Sonnets," contributed to a recent number of <i>The
    International</i>, which we inadvertently credited to his
    brother, T. Addison Richards the well-known and much esteemed
    landscape painter.</p>

    <p>MAJOR POUSSIN, so well-known for his long residence in this
    country as an officer of engineers, and, more recently, as
    Minister of the French republic,&mdash;which, intelligent men
    have no need to be assured, he represented with uniform wisdom
    and manliness,&mdash;is now engaged at Paris upon a new edition
    of his important book, <i>The Power and Prospects of the United
    States</i>. We perceive that he has lately published in the
    Republican journal <i>Le Credit</i>, a translation of the
    American instructions to Mr. Mann, respecting Hungary. In his
    preface to this document, Major Poussin pays the warmest
    compliments to the feelings, measures and policy of our
    administration, with which he contrasts, at the same time,
    those of the French Government. He hopes a great deal for the
    Democratic cause in Europe from the <i>moral influences</i> of
    the United States.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>DR. JOHN W. FRANCIS, one of the most excellent men, as well
    as one of the best physicians of New York, has received from
    Trinity College, Hartford, the degree of Doctor of Laws. We
    praise the authorities of Trinity for this judicious bestowal
    of its honors. Francis's career of professional usefulness and
    variously successful intellectual activity, are deserving such
    academical recognition. His genial love of learning, large
    intelligence, ready appreciation of individual merit, and that
    genuine love of country which has led him to the carefullest
    and most comprehensive study of our general and particular
    annals, and to the frequentest displays of the sources of its
    enduring grandeur, constitute in him a character eminently
    entitled to our affectionate admiration.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>THE POEMS OF GRAY, in an edition of singular typographical
    and pictorial beauty, are to be issued as one of the autumn
    gift-books by Henry C. Baird, of Philadelphia. They are to be
    edited by the tasteful and judicious critic, Professor Henry
    Reed, of the University of Pennsylvania, to whom we were
    indebted for the best edition of Wordsworth that appeared
    during the life of that poet. We have looked over Professor
    Reed's life of Gray, and have seen proofs of the admirable
    engravings with which the work will be embellished. It will be
    dedicated to our American Moxon, JAMES T. FIELDS, as a
    souvenir. we presume, of a visit to the grave of the bard,
    which the two young booksellers made together during a recent
    tour in Europe. Mr. Baird and Mr. Fields are of the small
    company of publishers, who, if it please them, can write their
    own books. They have both given pleasant evidence of abilities
    in this way.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>BURNS.&mdash;It appears from the Scotch papers that the
    house in Burns-street, Dumfries, in which the bard of "Tam
    o'Shanter" and his wife "bonnie Jean," lived and died, is about
    to come into the market by way of public auction.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>"EUROPE, PAST AND PRESENT:" A comprehensive manual of
    European Geography and History, derived from official and
    authentic sources, and comprising not only an accurate
    geographical and statistical description, but also a faithful
    and interesting history of all European States; to which is
    appended a copious and carefully arranged index, by Francis H.
    Ungewitter, LL.D.,&mdash;is a volume of some six hundred pages,
    just published by Mr. Putnam. It has been prepared with much
    well-directed labor, and will be found a valuable and
    comprehensive manual of reference upon all questions relating
    to the history, geographical position, and general statistics
    of the several States of Europe.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>M. LIBRI, of whose conviction at Paris (<i>par
    contumace</i>, that is, in default of appearance), of stealing
    books from public libraries, we have given some account in
    <i>The International</i>, is warmly and it appears to us
    successfully defended in the Athenæum, in which it is alleged
    that there was not a particle of legal evidence against him. M.
    Libri is, and was at the time of the appearance of the
    accusation against him, a political exile in England.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>MAJOR RAWLINSON, F.R.S., has published a "Commentary on the
    Cuneiform Inscriptions of Babylon and Assyria," including
    readings of the inscriptions on the Nimroud Obelisk, discovered
    by Mr. Layard, and a brief notice of the ancient kings of
    Nineveh and Babylon. It was read before the Royal Asiatic
    Society.</p>

    <p>REV. DR. WISEMAN, author of the admirable work on the
    Connection between Science and Religion, is to proceed to Rome
    toward the close of the present month to receive the hat of a
    cardinal. It is many years since any English Roman Catholic,
    resident in England, attained this honor.</p>

    <p>THE OHIO HISTORICAL SOCIETY has published several
    interesting volumes, of which the most important are those of
    Judge Burnett. An address, by William D. Gallagher, its
    President, on the History and Resources of the West and
    Northwest, has just been issued: and it has nearly ready for
    publication a volume of Mr. Hildreth.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>THE IMPERIAL LIBRARY AT VIENNA has been enriched by a very
    old Greek manuscript on the Advent of Christ, composed by a
    bishop of the second century, named Clement. This manuscript
    was discovered a short time since by M. Waldeck, the
    philologist, at Constantinople.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>MR. KEIGHTLEY's "History of Greece" has been translated into

    <p>WORDSWORTH'S POSTHUMOUS POEM, "The Prelude," is in the press
    of the Appletons, by whose courtesy we are enabled to present
    the readers of <i>The International</i> with the fourth canto
    of it, before its publication in England. The poem is a sort of
    autobiography in blank verse, marked by all the characteristics
    of the poet&mdash;his original vein of thought; his majestic,
    but sometimes diffuse, style of speculation; his large
    sympathies with humanity, from its proudest to its humblest
    forms. It will be read with great avidity by his
    admirers&mdash;and there are few at this day who do not belong
    to that class&mdash;as affording them a deeper insight into the
    mind of Wordsworth than any of his other works. It is divided
    into several books, named from the different situations or
    stages of the author's life, or the subjects which at any
    period particularly engaged his attention. We believe it will
    be more generally read than any poem of equal length that has
    issued from the press in this age.</p>

    <p>Miss COOPER's "RURAL HOURS"<a id="footnotetag1"
       name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a>
       is everywhere commended as one of the most charming pictures
       that have ever appeared of country life. The books of the
       Howitts, delineating the same class of subjects in England
       and Germany, are not to be compared to Miss Cooper's for
       delicate painting or grace and correctness of diction. The
       Evening Post observes:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"This is one of the most delightful books we have lately
        taken up. It is a journal of daily observations made by an
        intelligent and highly educated lady, residing in a most
        beautiful part of the country, commencing with the spring
        of 1848, and closing with the end of the winter of 1849.
        They almost wholly concern the occupations and objects of
        country life, and it is almost enough to make one in love
        with such a life to read its history so charmingly
        narrated. Every day has its little record in this
        volume,&mdash;the record of some rural employment, some
        note on the climate, some observation in natural history,
        or occasionally some trait of rural manners. The arrival
        and departure of the birds of passage is chronicled, the
        different stages of vegetation are noted, atmospheric
        changes and phenomena are described, and the various living
        inhabitants of the field and forest are made to furnish
        matter of entertainment for the reader. All this is done
        with great variety and exactness of knowledge, and without
        any parade of science. Descriptions of rural holidays and
        rural amusements are thrown in occasionally, to give a
        living interest to a picture which would otherwise become
        monotonous from its uniform quiet. The work is written in
        easy and flexible English, with occasional felicities of
        expression. It is ascribed, as we believe we have informed
        our readers, to a daughter of J. Fenimore Cooper. Our
        country is full of most interesting materials for a work of
        this sort; but we confess we hardly expected, at the
        present time, to see them collected and arranged by so
        skillful a hand."</p>

    <p>THE REV. SYDNEY SMITH's "Sketches of Modern Philosophy,"
    remarks the Tribune, "consist of a course of popular lectures
    on the subject, delivered in the Royal Institution of London in
    the years 1804-5-6. As a contribution to the science of which
    they profess to treat, their claims to respect are very
    moderate. Indeed, no one would ridicule any pretensions of that
    kind with more zeal than the author himself. The manuscripts
    were left in an imperfect state, Sydney Smith probably
    supposing that no call would ever be made for their
    publication. They were written merely for popular effect, to be
    spoken before a miscellaneous audience, in which any abstract
    topics of moral philosophy would be the last to awaken an
    interest. The title of the book is accordingly a misnomer. It
    would lead no one to suspect the rich and diversified character
    of its contents. They present no ambitious attempts at
    metaphysical disquisition. They are free from dry
    technicalities of ethical speculation. They have no specimens
    of logical hair-splitting, no pedantic array of barren
    definitions, no subtle distinctions proceeding from an
    ingenious fancy, and without any foundation in nature. On the
    contrary, we find in this volume a series of lively, off-hand,
    dashing comments on men and manners, often running into broad
    humor, and always marked with the pungent common sense that
    never forsook the facetious divine. His remarks on the conduct
    of the understanding, on literary habits, on the use and value
    of books, and other themes of a similar character, are for the
    most part instructive and practical as well as piquant, and on
    the whole, the admirers of Sydney Smith will have no reason to
    regret the publication of the volume."</p>

    <h2>BIOGRAPHY OF SIR ROBERT PEEL.</h2>

    <p>In the following brief narrative of the principal facts in
    the life of the great statesman who has just been snatched from
    among us, we must disclaim all intention of dealing with his
    biography in any searching or ambitious spirit. The national
    loss is so great, the bereavement is so sudden, that we cannot
    sit down calmly either to eulogize or arraign the memory of the
    deceased. We cannot forget that it was not a week ago we were
    occupied in recording and commenting upon his last eloquent
    address to that assembly which had so often listened with
    breathless attention to his statesmanlike expositions of
    policy. We could do little else when the mournful intelligence
    reached us that Sir Robert Peel was no more, than pen a few
    expressions of sorrow and respect. Even now the following
    imperfect record of facts must be accepted as a poor substitute
    for the biography <span class="pagenum"><a name="page197"
       id="page197"></a>[pg 197]</span> of that great Englishman
       whose loss will be felt almost as a private bereavement by
       every family throughout the British Empire:&mdash;</p>

    <p>Sir Robert Peel was in the 63d year of his age, having been
    born near Bury, in Lancashire, on the 5th of February, 1788.
    His father was a manufacturer on a grand scale, and a man of
    much natural ability, and of almost unequaled opulence. Full of
    a desire to render his son and probable successor worthy of the
    influence and the vast wealth which he had to bestow, the first
    Sir Robert Peel took the utmost pains personally with the early
    training of the future prime minister. He retained his son
    under his own immediate superintendence until he arrived at a
    sufficient age to be sent to Harrow. Lord Byron, his
    contemporary at Harrow, was a better declaimer and a more
    amusing actor, but in sound learning and laborious application
    to school duties young Peel had no equal. He had scarcely
    completed his 16th year when he left Harrow and became a
    gentleman commoner of Christ Church, Oxford, where he took the
    degree of A.B., in 1808, with unprecedented distinction.</p>

    <p>The year 1809 saw him attain his majority, and take his seat
    in the House of Commons as a member for Cashel, in
    Tipperary.</p>

    <p>The first Sir Robert Peel had long been a member of the
    House of Commons, and the early efforts of his son in that
    assembly were regarded with considerable interest, not only on
    account of his University reputation, but also because he was
    the son of such a father. He did not, however, begin public
    life by staking his fame on the results of one elaborate
    oration; on the contrary, he rose now and then on comparatively
    unimportant occasions; made a few brief modest remarks, stated
    a fact or two, explained a difficulty when he happened to
    understand the matter in hand better than others, and then sat
    down without taxing too severely the patience or good nature of
    an auditory accustomed to great performances. Still in the
    second year of his parliamentary course he ventured to make a
    set speech, when, at the commencement of the session of 1810,
    he seconded the address in reply to the King's speech.
    Thenceforward for nineteen years a more highflying Tory than
    Mr. Peel was not to be found within the walls of parliament.
    Lord Eldon applauded him as a young and valiant champion of
    those abuses in the state which were then fondly called "the
    institutions of the country." Lord Sidmouth regarded him as the
    rightful political heir, and even the Duke of Cumberland
    patronized Mr. Peel. He further became the favorite
    <i>eleve</i> of Mr. Perceval, the first lord of the treasury,
    and entered office as under-secretary for the home department.
    He continued in the home department for two years, not often
    speaking in parliament, but rather qualifying himself for those
    prodigious labors in debate, in council, and in office, which
    it has since been his lot to encounter and perform.</p>

    <p>In May, 1812, Mr. Perceval fell by the hand of an assassin,
    and the composition of the ministry necessarily underwent a
    great change. The result, so far as Mr. Peel was concerned,
    was, that he was appointed Chief Secretary to the
    Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. Mr. Peel had only reached his 26th
    year when, in the month of September, 1812, the duties of that
    anxious and laborious position were entrusted to his hands. The
    legislative union was then but lately consummated, and the
    demand for Catholic emancipation had given rise to an agitation
    of only very recent date. But, in proportion to its novelty, so
    was its vigor. Mr. Peel was, therefore, as the representative
    of the old tory Protestant school, called upon to encounter a
    storm of unpopularity, such as not even an Irish secretary has
    ever been exposed to. The late Mr. O'Connell in various forms
    poured upon Mr. Peel a torrent of invective which went beyond
    even his extraordinary performances in the science of scolding.
    At length he received from Mr. Peel a hostile message.
    Negotiations went on for three or four days, when Mr. O'Connell
    was taken into custody and bound over to keep the peace toward
    all his fellow-subjects in Ireland. Mr. Peel and his friend
    immediately went to England, and subsequently proceeded to the
    continent. Mr. O'Connell followed them to London, but the
    police were active enough to bring him before the chief
    justice, when he entered into recognizances to keep the peace
    toward all his majesty's subjects; and so ended one of the few
    personal squabbles in which Mr. Peel had ever been engaged. For
    six years he held the office of chief secretary to the
    lord-lieutenant, at a time when the government was conducted
    upon what might be called "anti-conciliation principles." The
    opposite course was commenced by Mr. Peel's immediate
    successor, Mr. Charles Grant, now Lord Glenelg.</p>

    <p>That a chief secretary so circumstanced, struggling to
    sustain extreme Orangeism in its dying agonies, should have
    been called upon to encounter great toil and anxiety is a truth
    too obvious to need illustration. That in these straits Mr.
    Peel acquitted himself with infinite address was as readily
    acknowledged at that time as it has ever been even in the
    zenith of his fame. He held office in that country under three
    successive viceroys, the Duke of Richmond, Earl Whitworth, and
    Earl Talbot, all of whom have long since passed away from this
    life, their names and their deeds long forgotten. But the
    history of their chief secretary happens not to have been
    composed of such perishable materials, and we now approach one
    of the most memorable passages of his eventful career. He was
    chairman of the great bullion committee; but before he engaged
    in that stupendous task he had resigned the chief secretaryship
    of Ireland. As a consequence of the report of that committee,
    he took charge of and introduced the bill for authorizing a
    return to <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198"
       id="page198"></a>[pg 198]</span> cash payments which bears
       his name, and which measure received the sanction of
       parliament in the year 1819. That measure brought upon Mr.
       Peel no slight or temporary odium. The first Sir Robert Peel
       was then alive, and altogether differed from his son as to
       the tendency of his measure. It was roundly asserted at the
       time, and very faintly denied, that it rendered that
       gentleman a more wealthy man, by something like half a
       million sterling, than he had previously been. The deceased
       statesman, however, must, in common justice, be acquitted of
       any sinister purpose.</p>

    <p>This narrative now reaches the year 1820, when we have to
    relate the only domestic event in the history of Sir Robert
    Peel which requires notice. On the 8th of June, being then in
    the 33d year of his age, he married Julia, daughter of General
    Sir John Floyd, who had then attained the age of 25.</p>

    <p>Two years afterward there was a lull in public affairs,
    which gave somewhat the appearance of tranquillity. Lord
    Sidmouth was growing old, he thought that his system was
    successful, and that at length he might find repose. He
    considered it then consistent with his public duty to consign
    to younger and stronger hands the seals of the home department.
    He accepted a seat in the cabinet without office, and continued
    to give his support to Lord Liverpool, his ancient political
    chief. In permitting his mantle to fall upon Mr. Peel, he
    thought he was assisting to invest with authority one whose
    views and policy were as narrow as his own, and whose practise
    in carrying them out would be not less rigid and
    uncompromising. But, like many others, he lived long enough to
    be grievously disappointed by the subsequent career of him whom
    the liberal party have since called "the great minister of
    progress," and whom their opponents have not scrupled to
    designate by appellations not to be repeated in these hours of
    sorrow and bereavement. On the 17th of January, 1822, Mr. Peel
    was installed at the head of the home department, where he
    remained undisturbed till the political demise of Lord
    Liverpool in the spring of 1827. The most distinguished man
    that has filled the chair of the House of Commons in the
    present century was Charles Abbott, afterward Lord Colchester.
    In the summer of 1817 he had completed sixteen years of hard
    service in that eminent office, and he had represented the
    University for eleven years. His valuable labors having been
    rewarded with a pension and a peerage, he took his seat, full
    of years and honors, among the hereditary legislators of the
    land, and left a vacancy in the representation of his <i>alma
    mater</i>, which Mr. Peel above all living men was deemed the
    most fitting person to occupy. At that time he was an intense
    tory&mdash;or as the Irish called him, an Orange Protestant of
    the deepest dye&mdash;one prepared to make any sacrifice for
    the maintenance of church and state as established by the
    revolution of 1688. Who, therefore, so fit as he to represent
    the loyalty, learning, and orthodoxy of Oxford? To have done so
    had been the object of Mr. Canning's young ambition: but in
    1817 he could not be so ungrateful to Liverpool as to reject
    its representation even for the early object of his
    parliamentary affections. Mr. Peel, therefore, was returned
    without opposition, for that constituency which many consider
    the most important in the land&mdash;with which he remained on
    the best possible terms for twelve years. The question of the
    repeal of the penal laws affecting the Roman Catholics, which
    severed so many political connections, was, however, destined
    to separate Mr. Peel from Oxford. In 1828 rumors of the coming
    change were rife, and many expedients were devised to extract
    his opinions on the Catholic question. But with the reserve
    which ever marked his character, left all curiosity at fault.
    At last, the necessities of the government rendered further
    concealment impossible, and out came the truth that he was no
    longer an Orangeman. The ardent friends who had frequently
    supported his Oxford elections, and the hot partisans who
    shouted "Peel and Protestantism," at the Brunswick Clubs,
    reviled him for his defection in no measured terms. On the 4th
    of February, 1829, he addressed a letter to the vice-chancellor
    of Oxford, stating, in many well-turned phrases, that the
    Catholic question must forthwith be adjusted, under advice in
    which he concurred; and that, therefore, he considered himself
    bound to resign that trust which the University had during so
    many years confided to his hands. His resignation was accepted;
    but as the avowed purpose of that important step was to give
    his constituents an opportunity of pronouncing an opinion upon
    a change of policy, he merely accepted the Chiltern Hundreds
    with the intention of immediately becoming a candidate for that
    seat in parliament which he had just vacated. At this election
    Mr. Peel was opposed by Sir Robert Inglis, who was elected by
    755 to 609. Mr. Peel was, therefore, obliged to cast himself on
    the favor of Sir Manasseh Lopez, who returned him for Westbury,
    in Wiltshire, which constituency he continued to represent two
    years, until at the general election in 1830 he was chosen for
    Tamworth, in the representation for which he continued for
    twenty years.</p>

    <p>The main features of his official life still remain to be
    noticed. With the exception of Lord Palmerston, no statesman of
    modern times has spent so many years in the civil service of
    the crown. If no account be taken of the short time he was
    engaged upon the bullion committee in effecting the change in
    the currency, and in opposing for a few months the ministries
    of Mr. Canning and Lord Goderich, it may be stated that from
    1810 to 1830 he formed part of the government, and presided
    over it as a first minister in 1834-5, as well as from 1841 to
    1846 inclusive. During the time that he held the office of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page199"
       id="page199"></a>[pg 199]</span> home secretary under Lord
       Liverpool he effected many important changes in the
       administration of domestic affairs, and many legislative
       improvements of a practical and comprehensive character. But
       his fame as member of parliament was principally sustained
       at this period of his life by the extensive and admirable
       alterations which he effected in the criminal law. Romilly
       and Mackintosh had preceded him in the great work of
       reforming and humanizing the code of England. For his hand,
       however, was reserved the introduction of ameliorations
       which they had long toiled and struggled for in vain. The
       ministry through whose influence he was enabled to carry
       these reforms lost its chief in Lord Liverpool during the
       early part of the year 1827. When Mr. Canning undertook to
       form a government, Mr. Peel, the late Lord Eldon, the Duke
       of Wellington, and other eminent tories of that day, threw
       up office, and are said to have persecuted Mr. Canning with
       a degree of rancor far outstripping the legitimate bounds of
       political hostility. Lord George Bentinck said "they hounded
       to the death my illustrious relative"; and the ardor of his
       subsequent opposition to Sir Robert Peel evidently derived
       its intensity from a long cherished sense of the injuries
       supposed to have been inflicted upon Mr. Canning. It is the
       opinion of men not ill informed respecting the sentiments of
       Canning, that he considered Peel as his true political
       successor&mdash;as a statesman competent to the task of
       working out that large and liberal policy which he fondly
       hoped the tories might, however tardily, be induced to
       sanction. At all events, he is believed not to have
       entertained toward Mr. Peel any personal hostility, and to
       have stated during his short-lived tenure of office that
       that gentleman was the only member of his party who had not
       treated him with ingratitude and unkindness.</p>

    <p>In January, 1828, the Wellington ministry took office and
    held it till November, 1830. Mr. Peel's reputation suffered
    during this period very rude shocks. He gave up, as already
    stated, his anti-Catholic principles, lost the force of twenty
    years' consistency, and under unheard-of disadvantages
    introduced the very measure he had spent so many years in
    opposing. The debates on Catholic emancipation, which preceded
    the great reform question, constitute a period in his life,
    which, twenty years ago, every one would have considered its
    chief and prominent feature. There can be no doubt that the
    course he then adopted demanded greater moral courage than at
    any previous period of his life he had been called upon to
    exercise. He believed himself incontestibly in the right; he
    believed, with the Duke of Wellington, that the danger of civil
    war was imminent, and that such an event was immeasurably a
    greater evil than surrendering the constitution of 1688. But he
    was called upon to snap asunder a parliamentary connection of
    twelve years with a great university, in which the most
    interesting period of his youth had been passed; to encounter
    the reproaches of adherents whom he had often led in
    well-fought contests against the advocates of what was termed
    "civil and religious liberty;" to tell the world that the
    character of public men for consistency, however precious, is
    not to be directly opposed to the common weal; and to
    communicate to many the novel as well as unpalatable truth that
    what they deemed "principle" must give way to what he called
    "expediency."</p>

    <p>When he ceased to be a minister of the crown, that general
    movement throughout Europe which succeeded the deposition of
    the elder branch of the Bourbons rendered parliamentary reform
    as unavoidable as two years previously Catholic emancipation
    had been. He opposed this change, no doubt with increased
    knowledge and matured talents, but with impaired influence and
    few parliamentary followers. The history of the reform debates
    will show that Sir Robert Peel made many admirable speeches,
    which served to raise his reputation, but never for a moment
    turned the tide of fortune against his adversaries, and in the
    first session of the first reformed parliament he found himself
    at the head of a party that in numbers little exceeded one
    hundred. As soon as it was practicable he rallied his broken
    forces; either he or some of his political friends gave them
    the name of "Conservatives," and it required but a short
    interval of reflection and observation to prove to his
    sagacious intellect that the period of reaction was at hand.
    Every engine of party organization was put into vigorous
    activity, and before the summer of 1834 reached its close he
    was at the head of a compact, powerful, and well-disciplined
    opposition. Such a high impression of their vigor and
    efficiency had King William IV received, that when, in
    November, Lord Althorp became a peer, and the whigs therefore
    lost their leader to the House of Commons, his Majesty sent in
    Italy to summon Sir Robert Peel to his councils, with a view to
    the immediate formation of a conservative ministry. He accepted
    this responsibility, though he thought the King had mistaken
    the condition of the country and the chances of success which
    had awaited his political friends. A new House of Commons was
    instantly called, and for nearly three months Sir Robert Peel
    maintained a struggle against the most formidable opposition
    that for nearly a century any minister had been called to
    encounter. At no time did his command of temper, his almost
    exhaustless resources of information, his vigorous and
    comprehensive intellect appear to create such astonishment or
    draw forth such unbounded admiration as in the early part of
    1835. But, after a well-fought contest he retired once more
    into the opposition till the close of the second Melbourne
    Administration in 1841. It was in April, 1835, that Lord
    Melbourne was restored to power, but the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page200"
       id="page200"></a>[pg 200]</span> continued enjoyment of
       office did not much promote the political interests of his
       party, and from various causes the power of the whigs began
       to decline. The commencement of a new reign gave them some
       popularity, but in the new House of Commons, elected in
       consequence of that event, the conservative party were
       evidently gaining strength; still, after the failure of
       1834-5, it was no easy task to dislodge an existing
       ministry, and at the same time to be prepared with a cabinet
       and a party competent to succeed them. Sir Robert Peel,
       therefore, with characteristic caution, "bided his time",
       conducting the business of opposition throughout the whole
       of this period with an ability and success of which history
       affords few examples. He had accepted the Reform Bill as the
       established law of England, and as the system upon which the
       country was thenceforward to be governed. He was willing to
       carry it out in its true spirit, but he would proceed no
       further. He marshaled his opposition upon the principle of
       resistance to any further organic changes, and he enlisted
       the majority of the peers and nearly the whole of the
       country gentlemen of England in support of the great
       principle of protection to British industry. The little
       maneuvres and small political intrigues of the period are
       almost forgotten, and the remembrance of them is scarcely
       worthy of revival. It may, however, be mentioned, that in
       1839 ministers, being left in a minority, resigned, and Sir
       Robert Peel, when sent for by the Queen, demanded that
       certain ladies in the household of her majesty,&mdash;the
       near relatives of eminent whig politicians,&mdash;should be
       removed from the personal service of the sovereign. As this
       was refused, he abandoned for the time any attempt to form a
       government, and his opponents remained in office till
       September, 1841. It was then Sir Robert Peel became the
       first lord of the treasury, and the Duke of Wellington,
       without office, accepted a seat in the cabinet, taking the
       management of the House of Lords. His ministry was formed on
       protectionist principles, but the close of its career was
       marked by the adoption of free trade doctrines differing in
       the widest and most liberal sense. Sir Robert Peel's sense
       of public duty impelled him once more to incur the odium and
       obliquy which attended a fundamental change of policy, and a
       repudiation of the political partizans by whose ardent
       support a minister may have attained office and authority.
       It was his fate to encounter more than any man ever did,
       that hostility which such conduct, however necessary, never
       fails to produce. This great change in our commercial
       policy, however unavoidable, must be regarded as the
       proximate cause of his final expulsion from office in July,
       1846. His administration, however, had been signalized by
       several measures of great political importance. Among the
       earliest and most prominent of these were his financial
       plans, the striking feature of which was an income-tax;
       greatly extolled for the exemption it afforded from other
       burdens pressing more severely on industry, but loudly
       condemned for its irregular and unequal operation, a vice
       which has since rendered its contemplated increase
       impossible.</p>

    <p>Of the ministerial life of Sir Robert Peel little more
    remains to be related except that which properly belongs rather
    to the history of the country than to his individual biography.
    But it would be unjust to the memory of one of the most
    sagacious statesman that England ever produced to deny that his
    latest renunciation of political principles required but two
    short years to attest the vital necessity of that unqualified
    surrender. If the corn laws had been in existence at the period
    when the political system of the continent was shaken to its
    centre and dynasties crumbled into dust, a question would have
    been left in the hands of the democratic party of England, the
    force of which neither skill nor influence could then have
    evaded. Instead of broken friendships, shattered reputations
    for consistency, or diminished rents, the whole realm of
    England might have borne a fearful share in that storm of wreck
    and revolution which had its crisis in the 10th of April,
    1848.</p>

    <p>In the course of his long and eventful life many honors were
    conferred upon Sir Robert Peel. Wherever he went, and almost at
    all times, he attracted universal attention, and was always
    received with the highest consideration. At the close of 1836
    the University of Glasgow elected him Lord Rector, and the
    conservatives of that city, in January, 1837, invited him to a
    banquet at which three thousand gentlemen assembled to do honor
    to their great political chief. But this was only one among
    many occasions on which he was "the great guest." Perhaps the
    most remarkable of these banquets was that given to him in 1835
    at Merchant Tailors' Hall by three hundred members of the House
    of Commons. Many other circumstances might be related to
    illustrate the high position which Sir Robert Peel occupied.
    Anecdotes innumerable might be recorded to show the
    extraordinary influence in Parliament which made him "the great
    commoner" of the age; for Sir Robert Peel was not only a
    skillful and adroit debater, but by many degrees the most able
    and one of the most eloquent men in either house of parliament.
    Nothing could be more stately or imposing than the long array
    of sounding periods in which he expounded his doctrines,
    assailed his political adversaries, or vindicated his own
    policy. But when the whole land laments his loss, when England
    mourns the untimely fate of one of her noblest sons, the task
    of critical disquisition upon literary attainments or public
    oratory possesses little attraction. It may be left for calmer
    moments, and a more distant time, to investigate with
    unforgiving justice the sources of his errors, or to estimate
    the precise value of services which the public is now disposed
    to regard with no other feelings than those of unmingled
    gratitude.</p>

    <h4>From the Art-Journal.</h4>

    <h2>MEMORIES OF MISS JANE PORTER.</h2>

    <h4>BY MRS. S.C. HALL.</h4>

    <p>The frequent observation of foreigners is, that in England
    we have few "celebrated women." Perhaps they mean that we have
    few who are "notorious;" but let us admit that in either case
    they are right; and may we not express our belief in its being
    better for women and for the community that such is the case.
    "Celebrity" rarely adds to the happiness of a woman, and almost
    as rarely increases her usefulness. The time and attention
    required to attain "celebrity," must, except under very
    peculiar circumstances, interfere with the faithful discharge
    of those feminine duties upon which the well-doing of society
    depends, and which shed so pure a halo around our English
    homes. Within these "homes" our heroes, statesmen,
    philosophers, men of letters, men of genius, receive their
    first impressions, and the <i>impetus</i> to a faithful
    discharge of their after callings as Christian subjects of the
    State.</p>

    <p>There are few of such men who do not trace back their
    resolution, their patriotism, their wisdom, their
    learning&mdash;the nourishment of all their higher
    aspirations&mdash;to a wise, hopeful, loving-hearted and
    faith-inspired Mother; one who believed in a son's destiny to
    be great; it may be, impelled to such belief rather by instinct
    than by reason: who cherished (we can find no better word) the
    "Hero-feeling" of devotion to what was right; though it might
    have been unworldly; and whose deep heart welled up perpetual
    love and patience toward the overboiling faults and frequent
    stumblings of a hot youth, which she felt would mellow into a
    fruitful manhood.</p>

    <p>The strength and glory of England are in the keeping of the
    wives and mothers of its men; and when we are questioned
    touching our "celebrated women", we may in general terms refer
    to those who have watched over, moulded, and inspired our
    "celebrated men".</p>

    <p>Happy is the country where the laws of God and Nature are
    held in reverence&mdash;where each sex fulfills its peculiar
    duties, and renders its sphere a sanctuary! And surely such
    harmony is blessed by the Almighty&mdash;for while other
    nations writhe in anarchy and poverty, our own spreads wide her
    arms to receive all who seek protection or need repose.</p>

    <p>But if we have few "celebrated" women, few who, impelled
    either by circumstances or the irrepressible restlessness of
    genius, go forth amid the pitfalls of publicity, and battle
    with the world, either as poets, or dramatists, or moralists,
    or mere tale-tellers in simple prose&mdash;or, more dangerous
    still, "hold the mirror up to nature" on the stage that mimics
    life&mdash;if we have but few, we have, and have had
    <i>some</i>, of whom we are justly proud; women of such
    well-balanced minds, that toil they ever so laboriously in
    their public and perilous paths, their domestic and social
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202"
       id="page202"></a>[pg 202]</span> duties have been fulfilled
       with as diligent and faithful love as though the world had
       never been purified and enriched by the treasures of their
       feminine wisdom; yet this does not shake our belief, that
       despite the spotless and well-earned reputations they
       enjoyed, the homage they received, (and it has its charm,)
       and even the blessed consciousness of having contributed to
       the healthful recreation, the improved morality, the
       diffusion of the best sort of knowledge&mdash;the
       <i>woman</i> would have been happier had she continued
       enshrined in the privacy of domestic love and domestic duty.
       She may not think this at the commencement of her career;
       and at its termination, if she has lived sufficiently long
       to have descended, even gracefully, from her pedestal, she
       may often recall the homage of the <i>past</i> to make up
       for its lack in the <i>present</i>. But so perfectly is
       woman constituted for the cares, the affections, the
       duties&mdash;the blessed duties of un-public life&mdash;that
       if she give nature way it will whisper to her a text, that
       "celebrity never added to the happiness of a true woman".
       She must look for her happiness to HOME. We would have young
       women ponder over this, and watch carefully, ere the veil is
       lifted, and the hard cruel eye of public criticism fixed
       upon them. No profession is pastime; still less so now than
       ever, when so many people are "clever", though so few are
       great. We would pray those especially who direct their
       thoughts to literature, to think of what they have to say,
       and why they wish to say it; and above all, to weigh what
       they may expect from a capricious public, against the
       blessed shelter and pure harmonies of private life.</p>

    <p>But we have had some&mdash;and still have
    some&mdash;"celebrated" women, of whom we have said "we may be
    justly proud". We have done pilgrimage to the shrine of Lady
    Rachel Russell, who was so thoroughly "domestic", that the
    Corinthian beauty of her character would never have been matter
    of history, but for the wickedness of a bad king. We have
    recorded the hours spent with Hannah More; the happy days
    passed with, and the years invigorated by, the advice and
    influence of Maria Edgworth. We might recall the stern and
    faithful puritanism of Maria Jane Jewsbury, and the Old World
    devotion of the true and high-souled daughter of
    Israel&mdash;Grace Aguilar. The mellow tones of Felicia Hemans'
    poetry lingers still among all who appreciate the holy
    sympathies of religion and virtue. We could dwell long and
    profitably on the enduring patience and lifelong labor of
    Barbara Hofland, and steep a diamond in tears to record the
    memories of L.E.L. We could,&mdash;alas! alas! barely five and
    twenty years' acquaintance with literature and its ornaments,
    and the brilliant catalogue is but a <i>Memento Mori</i>.
    Perhaps of all this list, Maria Edgworth's life was the
    happiest: simply because she was the most retired, the least
    exposed to the gaze and observation of the world, the most
    occupied by loving duties toward the most united circle of old
    and young we ever saw assembled in one happy home.</p>

    <p>The very young have never, perhaps, read one of the tales of
    a lady whose reputation as a novelist was in its zenith when
    Walter Scott published his first novel. We desire to place a
    chaplet upon the grave of a woman once "celebrated" all over
    the known world, yet who drew all her happiness from the
    lovingness of home and friends, while her life was as pure as
    her renown was extensive.</p>

    <p>In our own childhood romance-reading was prohibited, but
    earnest entreaty procured an exception in favor of the
    "Scottish Chiefs". It was the bright summer, and we read it by
    moonlight, only disturbed by the murmur of the distant ocean.
    We read it, crouched in the deep recess of the nursery-window;
    we read it until moonlight and morning met, and the
    breakfast-bell ringing out into the soft air from the old
    gable, found us at the end of the fourth volume. Dear old
    times! when it would have been deemed little less than
    sacrilege to crush a respectable romance into a shilling
    volume, and our mammas considered <i>only</i> a five-volume
    story curtailed of its just proportions.</p>

    <p>Sir William Wallace has never lost his heroic ascendancy
    over us, and we have steadily resisted every temptation to open
    the "popular edition" of the long-loved romance, lest what
    people will call "the improved state of the human mind", might
    displace the sweet memory of the mingled admiration and
    indignation that chased each other, while we read and wept,
    without ever questioning the truth of the absorbing
    narrative.</p>

    <p>Yet the "Scottish Chiefs" scarcely achieved the popularity
    of "Thaddeus of Warsaw"&mdash;the first romance originated by
    the active brain and singularly constructive power of Jane
    Porter&mdash;produced at an almost girlish age.</p>

    <p>The hero of "Thaddeus of Warsaw" was really Kosciuszko, the
    beloved pupil of George Washington, the grandest and purest
    patriot the modern world has known. The enthusiastic girl was
    moved to its composition by the stirring times in which she
    lived, and a personal observation of and acquaintance with some
    of those brave men whose struggles for liberty only ceased with
    their exile or their existence.</p>

    <p>Miss Porter placed her standard of excellence on high
    ground, and&mdash;all gentle-spirited as was her
    nature&mdash;it was firm and unflinching toward what she
    believed the right and true. We must not therefore judge her by
    the depressed state of "feeling" in these times, when its
    demonstration is looked upon as artificial or affected. Toward
    the termination of the last, and the commencement of the
    present century, the world was roused into an interest and
    enthusiasm, which now we can scarcely appreciate or account
    for; the sympathies of England were awakened by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page203"
       id="page203"></a>[pg 203]</span> the terrible revolutions of
       France and the desolation of Poland; as a principle, we
       hated Napoleon, though he had neither act nor part in the
       doings of the democrats; and the sea-songs of Dibdin, which
       our youth <i>now</i> would call uncouth and ungraceful
       rhymes, were key-notes to public feeling; the English of
       that time were thoroughly "awake"&mdash;the British Lion had
       not slumbered through a thirty years' peace. We were a
       nation of soldiers, and sailors, and patriots; not of
       mingled cotton-spinners, and railway speculators, and angry
       protectionists. We do not say which state of things is best
       or worst, we desire merely to account for what may be called
       the taste for <i>heroic</i> literature at that time, and the
       taste for&mdash;we really hardly know what to call
       it&mdash;literature of the present, made up, as it too
       generally is, of shreds and patches&mdash;bits of gold and
       bits of tinsel&mdash;things written in a hurry, to be read
       in a hurry, and never thought of afterward&mdash;suggestive
       rather than reflective, at the best: and we must plead
       guilty to a too great proneness to underrate what our
       fathers probably overrated.</p>

    <p>At all events we must bear in mind, while reading or
    thinking over Miss Porter's novels, that in her day, even the
    exaggeration of enthusiasm was considered good tone and good
    taste. How this enthusiasm was <i>fostered</i>, not subdued,
    can be gathered by the author's ingenious preface to the, we
    believe, tenth edition of "Thaddeus of Warsaw."</p>

    <div class="figcenter"
         style="width:90%;">
        <a href="images/211.png"><img width="100%"

    <p>This story brought her abundant honors, and rendered her
    society, as well as the society of her sister and brother,
    sought for by all who aimed at a reputation for taste and
    talent. Mrs. Porter, on her husband's death, (he was the
    younger son of a well-connected Irish family, born in Ireland,
    in or near Coleraine, we believe, and a major in the
    Enniskillen Dragoons,) sought a residence for her family in
    Edinburgh, where education and good society are attainable to
    persons of moderate fortunes, if they are "well-born;" but the
    extraordinary artistic skill of her son Robert required a wider
    field, and she brought her children to London sooner than she
    had intended, that his promising talents might be cultivated.
    We believe the greater part of "Thaddeus of Warsaw" was written
    in London, either in St. Martin's Lane, Newport Street, or
    Gerard Street, Soho, (for in these three streets the family
    lived after their arrival in the metropolis); though, as soon
    as Robert Ker Porter's abilities floated him on the stream, his
    mother and sisters retired, in the brightness of their fame and
    beauty, to the village of Thames Ditton, a residence they loved
    to speak of as their "home." The actual labor of
    "Thaddeus"&mdash;her first novel&mdash;must have been
    considerable: for testimony was frequently borne to the
    fidelity of its localities, and Poles refused to believe the
    author had not visited Poland; indeed, she had a happy power in
    describing localities. It was on the publication of Miss
    Porter's two first works in the German language that their
    author was honored by being made a Lady of the Chapter of St.
    Joachim, and received the gold cross of the order from
    Wurtemberg; but "The Scottish Chiefs" was never so popular on
    the Continent as "Thaddeus of Warsaw", although Napoleon
    honored it with an interdict, to prevent its circulation in
    France. If Jane Porter owed her Polish inspirations so
    peculiarly to the tone of the times in which she lived, she
    traces back, in her introduction to the latest
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page204"
       id="page204"></a>[pg 204]</span> edition of "The Scottish
       Chiefs." her enthusiasm in the cause of Sir William Wallace
       to the influence an old "Scotch wife's" tales and ballads
       produced upon her mind while in early childhood. She
       wandered amid what she describes as "beautiful green banks,"
       which rose in natural terraces behind her mothers house, and
       where a cow and a few sheep occasionally fed. This house
       stood alone, at the head of a little square, near the high
       school; the distinguished Lord Elchies formerly lived in the
       house, which was very ancient, and from those green banks it
       commanded a fine view of the Firth of Forth. While gathering
       "<i>gowans</i>" or other wild-flowers for her infant sister,
       (whom she loved more dearly than her life, during the years
       they lived in most tender and affectionate companionship),
       she frequently encountered this aged woman, with her
       knitting in her hand; and she would speak to the eager and
       intelligent child of the blessed quiet of the land, where
       the cattle were browsing without fear of an enemy; and then
       she would talk of the awful times of the brave Sir William
       Wallace, when he fought for Scotland, "against a cruel
       tyrant; like unto them whom Abraham overcame when he
       recovered Lot, with all his herds and flocks, from the proud
       foray of the robber kings of the South," who, she never
       failed to add, "were all rightly punished for oppressing the
       stranger in a foreign land! for the Lord careth for the
       stranger." Miss Porter says that this woman never omitted
       mingling pious allusions with her narrative. "Yet she was a
       person of low degree, dressed in a coarse woollen gown, and
       a plain <i>Mutch</i> cap, clasped under the chin with a
       silver brooch, which her father had worn at the battle of
       Culloden." Of course she filled with tales of Sir William
       Wallace and the Bruce the listening ears of the lovely Saxon
       child, who treasured them in her heart and brain, until they
       fructified in after years into "The Scottish Chiefs." To
       these two were added "The Pastor's Fireside," and a number
       of other tales and romances. She contributed to several
       annuals and magazines, and always took pains to keep up the
       reputation she had won, achieving a large share of the
       popularity, to which, as an author, she never looked for
       happiness. No one could be more alive to praise or more
       grateful for attention, but the heart of a genuine, pure,
       loving woman, beat within Jane Porter's bosom, and she was
       never drawn out of her domestic circle by the flattery that
       has spoiled so many, men as well as women. Her mind was
       admirably balanced by her home affections, which remained
       unsullied and unshaken to the end of her days. She had, in
       common with her three brothers and her charming sister, the
       advantage of a wise and loving mother&mdash;a woman pious
       without cant, and worldly-wise without being worldly. Mrs.
       Porter was born at Durham, and when very young bestowed her
       hand and heart on Major Porter. An old friend of the family
       assures us that two or three of their children were born in
       Ireland, and that certainly Jane was amongst the number.
       Although she left Ireland when in early youth, perhaps
       almost an infant, she certainly must be considered Irish, as
       her father was so both by birth and descent, and esteemed
       during his brief life as a brave and generous gentleman. He
       died young, leaving his lovely widow in straitened
       circumstances, having only her widow's pension to depend on.
       The eldest son&mdash;afterward Colonel Porter&mdash;was sent
       to school by his grandfather.</p>

    <p>We have glanced briefly at Sir Robert Ker Porter's wonderful
    talents, and Anna Maria, when in her twelfth year, rushed, as
    Jane acknowledged, "prematurely into print." Of Anna Maria we
    knew personally but very little, enough however to recall with
    a pleasant memory her readiness in conversation and her bland
    and cheerful manners. No two sisters could have been more
    different in bearing and appearance; Maria was a delicate
    blonde, with a <i>riant</i> face, and an animated
    manner&mdash;we had said almost <i>peculiarly
    Irish</i>&mdash;rushing at conclusions, where her more
    thoughtful and careful sister paused to consider and calculate.
    The beauty of Jane was statuesque, her deportment serious yet
    cheerful, a seriousness quite as natural as her younger
    sister's gaiety; they both labored diligently, but Anna Maria's
    labor was sport when compared to her eldest sister's careful
    toil; Jane's mind was of a more lofty order, she was intense,
    and felt more than she said, while Anna Maria often said more
    than she felt; they were a delightful contrast, and yet the
    harmony between them was complete; and one of the happiest days
    we ever spent, while trembling on the threshold of literature,
    was with them at their pretty road-side cottage in the village
    of Esher before the death of their venerable and dearly beloved
    mother, whose rectitude and prudence had both guided and
    sheltered their youth, and who lived to reap with them the
    harvest of their industry and exertion. We remember the drive
    there, and the anxiety as to how those very "clever ladies"
    would look, and what they would say; we talked over the various
    letters we had received from Jane, and thought of the cordial
    invitation to their cottage&mdash;their "mother's
    cottage"&mdash;as they always called it. We remember the old
    white friendly spaniel who looked at us with blinking eyes, and
    preceded us up stairs; we remember the formal old-fashioned
    courtesy of the venerable old lady, who was then nearly
    eighty&mdash;the blue ribands and good-natured frankness of
    Anna Maria, and the noble courtesy of Jane, who received
    visitors as if she granted an audience; this manner was natural
    to her; it was only the manner of one whose thoughts have dwelt
    more upon heroic deeds, and lived more with heroes than with
    actual living men and women; the effect of this, however, soon
    passed away, but not so the fascination which was in all she
    said and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page205"
       id="page205"></a>[pg 205]</span> did. Her voice was soft and
       musical, and her conversation addressed to one person rather
       than to the company at large, while Maria talked rapidly to
       every one, or <i>for</i> every one who chose to listen. How
       happily the hours passed!&mdash;we were shown some of those
       extraordinary drawings of Sir Robert, who gained an artists
       reputation before he was twenty, and attracted the attention
       of West and Shee<a id="footnotetag2"
       name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
       in his mere boyhood. We heard all the interesting
       particulars of his panoramic picture of the Storming of
       Seringapatam, which, the first of its class, was known half
       over the world. We must not, however, be
       misunderstood&mdash;there was neither personal nor family
       egotism in the Porters; they invariably spoke of each other
       with the tenderest affection&mdash;but unless the
       conversation was <i>forced</i> by their friends&mdash;they
       never mentioned their own, or each other's works, while they
       were most ready to praise what was excellent in the works of
       others; they spoke with pleasure of their sojourns in
       London; while their mother said, it was much wiser and
       better for young ladies who were not rich, to live quietly
       in the country, and escape the temptations of luxury and
       display. At that time the "young ladies" seemed to us
       certainly <i>not</i> young: that was about two-and-twenty
       years ago, and Jane Porter was seventy-five when she died.
       They talked much of their previous dwelling at Thames
       Ditton, of the pleasant neighborhood they enjoyed there,
       though their mother's health and their own had much improved
       since their residence on Esher hill; their little garden was
       bounded at the back by the beautiful park of Claremont, and
       the front of the house overlooked the leading roads, broken
       as they are by the village green, and some noble elms. The
       view is crowned by the high trees of Esher Place; opening
       from the village on that side of the brow of the hill. Jane
       pointed out the <i>locale</i> of the proud Cardinal Wolsey's
       domain, inhabited during the days: of his power over Henry
       VIII., and in their cloudy evening, when that capricious
       monarch's favor changed to bitterest hate. It was the very
       spot to foster her high romance, while she could at the same
       time enjoy the sweets of that domestic converse she loved
       best of all. We were prevented by the occupations and
       heart-beatings of our own literary labors from repeating
       this visit; and in 1831, four years after these
       well-remembered hours, the venerable mother of a family so
       distinguished in literature and art, rendering their names
       known and honored wherever art and letters flourish, was
       called HOME. The sisters, who had resided ten years at
       Esher, left it, intending to sojourn for a time with their
       second brother, Doctor Porter, (who commenced his career as
       a surgeon in the navy) in Bristol; but within a year the
       youngest, the light-spirited, bright-hearted Anna Maria
       died; her sister was dreadfully shaken by her loss, and the
       letters we received from her after this bereavement, though
       containing the outpourings of a sorrowing spirit, were full
       of the certainty of that re-union hereafter which became the
       hope of her life. She soon resigned her cottage home at
       Esher, and found the affectionate welcome she so well
       deserved in many homes, where friends vied with each other
       to fill the void in her sensitive heart. She was of too wise
       a nature, and too sympathizing a habit, to shut out new
       interests and affections, but her <i>old ones</i> never
       withered, nor were they ever replaced; were the love of such
       a sister-friend&mdash;the watchful tenderness and
       uncompromising love of a mother&mdash;ever "replaced," to a
       lonely sister <i>or</i> a bereaved daughter! Miss Porters
       pen had been laid aside for some time, when suddenly she
       came before the world as the editor of "Sir Edward Seward's
       Narrative", and set people hunting over old atlases to find
       out the island where he resided. The whole was a clever
       fiction; yet Miss Porter never confided its authorship, we
       believe, beyond her family circle; perhaps the
       correspondence and documents, which are in the hands of one
       of her kindest friends (her executor), Mr. Shepherd, may
       throw some light upon a subject which the "Quarterly"
       honored by an article. We think the editor certainly used
       her pen as well as her judgment in the work, and we have
       imagined that it might have been written by the family
       circle, more in sport than in earnest, and then produced to
       serve a double purpose.</p>

    <p>After her sister's death Miss Jane Porter was afflicted with
    so severe an illness, that we, in common with her other
    friends, thought it impossible she could carry out her plan of
    journeying to St. Petersburgh to visit her brother, Sir Robert
    Ker Porter, who had been long united to a Russian princess, and
    was then a widower; her strength was fearfully reduced; her
    once round figure become almost spectral, and little beyond the
    placid and dignified expression of her noble countenance
    remained to tell of her former beauty; but her resolve was
    taken; she wished, she said, to see once more her youngest and
    most beloved brother, so distinguished in several careers,
    almost deemed incompatible,&mdash;as a painter, an author, a
    soldier, and a diplomatist, and nothing could turn her from her
    purpose: she reached St. Petersburgh in safety, and with
    apparently improved health, found her brother as much courted
    and beloved there as in his own land, and his daughter married
    to a Russian of high distinction. Sir Robert longed to return
    to England. He did not complain of any illness, and everything
    was arranged for their departure; his final visits were paid,
    all but one to the Emperor, who had ever treated him as a
    friend; the day before his intended journey he went to the
    palace, was graciously received, and then drove home, but when
    the servant opened the carriage-door at his own residence he
    was dead! One sorrow after another
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"
       id="page206"></a>[pg 206]</span> pressed heavily upon her;
       yet she was still the same sweet, gentle, holy-minded woman
       she had ever been, bending with Christian faith to the will
       of the Almighty,&mdash;"biding her time".</p>

    <p>How differently would she have "watched and waited" had she
    been tainted by vanity, or fixed her soul on the mere triumphs
    of "literary reputation". While firm to her own creed, she
    fully enjoyed the success of those who scramble up&mdash;where
    she bore the standard to the heights of Parnassus; she was
    never more happy than when introducing some literary "Tyro" to
    those who could aid or advise a future career. We can speak
    from experience of the warm interest she took in the Hospital
    for the cure of Consumption, and the Governesses' Benevolent
    Institution; during the progress of the latter, her health was
    painfully feeble, yet she used her personal influence for its
    success, and worked with her own hands for its bazaars. She was
    ever aiding those who could not aid themselves; and all her
    thoughts, words, and deeds, were evidence of her clear,
    powerful mind and kindly loving heart; her appearance in the
    London <i>coteries</i> was always hailed with interest and
    pleasure; to the young she was especially affectionate; but it
    was in the quiet mornings, or in the long twilight evenings of
    summer, when visiting her cherished friends at Shirley Park, in
    Kensington Square, or wherever she might be located for the
    time&mdash;it was then that her former spirit revived, and she
    poured forth anecdote and illustration, and the store of many
    years' observation, filtered by experience and purified by that
    delightful faith to which she held,&mdash;that "all things work
    together for good to them that love the Lord". She held this in
    practice, even more than in theory; you saw her chastened yet
    hopeful spirit beaming forth from her gentle eyes, and her
    sweet smile can never be forgotten. The last time we saw her,
    was about two years ago&mdash;in Bristol&mdash;at her
    brother's, Dr. Porter's, house in Portland Square: then she
    could hardly stand without assistance, yet she never complained
    of her own suffering or feebleness, all her anxiety was about
    the brother&mdash;then dangerously ill, and now the last of
    "his race." Major Porter, it will be remembered, left five
    children, and these have left only one descendant&mdash;the
    daughter of Sir Robert Ker Porter and the Russian Princess whom
    he married, a young Russian lady, whose present name we do not
    even know.</p>

    <p>We did not think at our last leave-taking that Miss Porter's
    fragile frame could have so long withstood the Power that takes
    away all we hold most dear; but her spirit was at length
    summoned, after a few days' total insensibility, on the 24th of
    May.</p>

    <p>We were haunted by the idea that the pretty cottage at
    Esher, where we spent those happy hours, had been treated even
    as "Mrs. Porter's Arcadia" at Thames Ditton&mdash;now
    altogether removed; and it was with a melancholy pleasure we
    found it the other morning in nothing changed; and it was
    almost impossible to believe that so many years had passed
    since our last visit. While Mr. Fairholt was sketching the
    cottage, we knocked at the door, and were kindly permitted by
    two gentle sisters, who now inhabit it, to enter the little
    drawing-room and walk round the garden: except that the
    drawing-room has been re-papered and painted, and that there
    were no drawings and no flowers the room was not in the least
    altered; yet to us it seemed like a sepulcher, and we rejoiced
    to breathe the sweet air of the little garden, and listen to a
    nightingale, whose melancholy cadence harmonized with our
    feelings.</p>

    <p>"Whenever you are at Esher," said the devoted daughter, the
    last time we conversed with her, "do visit my mother's tomb."
    We did so. A cypress flourishes at the head of the grave; and
    the following touching inscription is carved on the
    stone:&mdash;</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Here sleeps in Jesus a Christian widow, JANE PORTER.
        Obiit June 18th, 1831, ætat. 86; the beloved mother of W.
        Porter, M.D., of Sir Robert Ker Porter, and of Jane and
        Anna Maria Porter, who mourn in hope, humbly trusting to be
        born again with her unto the blessed kingdom of their Lord
        and Savior. Respect her grave, for she ministered to the
        poor.</p>

    <h2>Recent Deaths.</h2>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h3>MR. KIRBY, THE ENTOMOLOGIST.</h3>

    <p>The Rev. William Kirby, Rector of Barham, Suffolk, who died
    on the 4th ult. in the ninety-first year of his age, with his
    faculties little impaired, ranked as the father of Entomology
    in England; and to the successful results of his labors may he
    chiefly attributed the advance which has been made in this over
    other kindred departments of natural history. His reputation is
    based not so much on the discoveries made by him in the science
    as on the manner of its teaching. No man ever approached the
    study of the works of nature with a purer or more earnest zeal.
    His interpretation of the distinguishing characters of insects
    for the purposes of classification has excited the warmest
    approval of entomologists at home and abroad; while his
    agreeable narrative of their wonderful transformations and
    habits, teeming with analyses and anecdote, has a charm for
    almost every kind of reader.</p>

    <p>Mr. Kirby's first work of particular note was the
    "Monographia Apum Angliæ", in two volumes published half a
    century ago at Ipswich; to which town he was much endeared, and
    in whose Museum, as President, under the friendly auspices of
    its Secretary, Mr. George Ransome, he took a lively interest.
    His admirable work on the Wild Bees of Great Britain was
    composed from materials collected almost entirely by
    himself,&mdash;and most of the plates were of his etching.
    Entomology was at that time a comparatively new science in this
    country, and it is an <span class="pagenum"><a name="page207"
       id="page207"></a>[pg 207]</span> honorable proof of the
       correctness of the author's views that they are still
       acknowledged to be genuine.</p>

    <p>His further progress in entomology is abundantly marked by
    various papers in the "Transactions of the Linnæan
    Society",&mdash;by the entomological portion of the Bridgewater
    Treatise "On the History, Habits, and Instincts of
    Animals,"&mdash;and by his descriptions, occupying a quarto
    volume, of the insects of Sir John Richardson's "Fauna
    Boreali-Americana." The name of Kirby will, however, be chiefly
    remembered for the "Introduction on Entomology" written by him
    in conjunction with Mr. Spence. In this work a vast amount of
    material, acquired after many years' unremitting observation of
    the insect world, is mingled together by two different but
    congenial minds in the pleasant form of familiar letters. The
    charm, based on substantial knowledge of the subject, which
    these letters impart, has caused them to be studied with an
    interest never before excited by any work on natural
    history,&mdash;and they have served for the model of many an
    interesting and instructive volume. Whether William Kirby or
    William Spence had the more meritorious share in the
    composition of these Letters, has never been ascertained; for
    each, in the plenitude of his esteem and love for the other,
    renounced all claim, in favor of his coadjutor, to whatever
    portion of the matter might be most valued.</p>

    <p>In addition to the honor of being President of the Museum of
    his county town&mdash;in which there is an admirable portrait
    of him&mdash;Mr. Kirby was Honorary President of the
    Entomological Society of London, Fellow of the Royal, Linnæan,
    Geological, and Zoological Societies of the same city, and
    corresponding member of several foreign societies.</p>

    <h2>The Fine Arts.</h2>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>One of the favorite painters of Paris is Ingres, renowned
    especially for the beauty of his designs from the human figure,
    and the sweetness of his coloring. Eight years ago he was
    commissioned by M. de Luynes, who then wore the title of
    Duke&mdash;which, it must be said, he is still called by,
    though the Republic frowns on such aristocratic
    distinctions&mdash;to paint two historical pictures in fresco,
    for a country-house near Paris. The subjects were left to the
    choice of the artist, who was to have 100,000 francs (or
    £20,000) for the two pictures, one quarter of which was paid
    him in advance. During these eight years Mr. Ingres has begun
    various designs, and done his best to satisfy himself in the
    planning and execution of the pictures; but in vain did he blot
    out one design and labor long and earnestly upon
    another&mdash;success still fled from his pencil. At last,
    after eight years' fruitless exertion, he despaired, and going
    to M. de Luynes, told him that he could not make the pictures.
    At the same time he offered to return the £5,000; but M. de
    Luynes, one of the most munificent gentlemen in France, refused
    to receive it. Madame Ingres, however, arranged the difficulty.
    She remembered that during these eight years her kitchen had
    been regularly supplied with vegetables from M. de Luynes'
    garden, and these she insisted on paying for. "Very well," said
    M. de Luynes, "if you will have it so, my gardener shall bring
    you his bill." Accordingly, not long after, the gardener
    brought a bill for twenty-five francs. "My friend," said Madame
    Ingres to him, "you are mistaken in the amount: this is very
    natural, considering the length of the time. I have a better
    memory: your master will find in this envelope the exact sum."
    When M. de Luynes opened the envelope, he found in it bills for
    twenty thousand francs.</p>

    <p>LESTER, BRADY &amp; DAVIGNON's "<i>Gallery of Illustrious
    Americans</i>," is very favorably noticed generally by the
    foreign critics. <i>The Art Journal</i> says of it: "This work
    is, as its title imports, of a strictly national character,
    consisting of portraits and biographical sketches of
    twenty-four of the most eminent of the citizens of the
    Republic, since the death of Washington; beautifully
    lithographed from daguerreotypes. Each number is devoted to a
    portrait and memoir, the first being that of General Taylor
    (eleventh President of the United States), the second, of John
    C. Calhoun. Certainly, we have never seen more truthful copies
    of nature than these portraits; they carry in them an indelible
    stamp of all that earnestness and power for which our
    trans-Atlantic brethren have become famous, and are such heads
    as Lavater would have delighted to look upon. They are, truly,
    speaking likenesses, and impress all who see them with the
    certainty of their accuracy, so self-evident is their
    character. We are always rejoiced to notice a great nation
    doing honor to its great men; it is a noble duty which when
    properly done honors all concerned therewith. We see no reason
    to doubt that America may in this instance rank with the
    greatest."</p>

    <p>DR. WAAGEN, so well known for his writings on Art, is at

    of the private collection of pictures there, but principally to
    make himself acquainted with ancient illuminated manuscripts in
    several British collections.</p>

            <p>I overlooked the bed of Windermere,</p>

            <p>Like a vast river, stretching in the sun.</p>

            <p>With exultation at my feet I saw</p>

            <p>The boyish spirit flagged, and day by day</p>

            <p>Along my veins I kindled with the stir,</p>

            <p>The fermentation, and the vernal heat</p>

            <p>Of poesy, affecting private shades</p>

            <p>Like a sick Lover, then this dog was used</p>

            <p>To watch me, an attendant and a friend,</p>

            <p>Obsequious to my steps early and late,</p>

            <p>Though often of such dilatory walk</p>

            <p>Tired, and uneasy at the halts I made.</p>

            <p>A hundred times when, roving high and low,</p>

            <p>I have been harassed with the toil of verse,</p>

            <p>Much pains and little progress, and at once</p>

            <p>Some lovely Image in the song rose up</p>

            <p>Full-formed, like Venus rising from the sea;</p>

            <p>Then have I darted forward to let loose</p>

            <p>My hand upon his back with stormy joy,</p>

            <p>Caressing him again and yet again.</p>

            <p>And when at evening on the public way</p>

            <p>I sauntered, like a river murmuring</p>

            <p>And talking to itself when all things else</p>

            <p>Are still, the creature trotted on before;</p>

            <p>Such was his custom; but whene'er he met</p>

            <p>A passenger approaching, he would turn</p>

            <p>To give me timely notice, and straightway,</p>

            <p>Grateful for that admonishment, I hushed</p>

            <p>My voice, composed my gait, and, with the air</p>

            <p>And mein of one whose thoughts are free,
            advanced</p>

            <p>To give and take a greeting that might save</p>

            <p>My name from piteous rumors, such as wait</p>

            <p>On men suspected to be crazed in brain.</p>

            <p class="i2">Those walks well worth to be prized and
            loved&mdash;</p>

            <p>Regretted!&mdash;that word, too, was on my
            tongue,</p>

            <p>But they were richly laden with all good,</p>

            <p>And cannot be remembered but with thanks</p>

            <p>And gratitude, and perfect joy of heart&mdash;</p>

            <p>Those walks in all their freshness now came back</p>

            <p>Like a returning Spring. When first I made</p>

            <p>Once more the circuit of our little lake,</p>

            <p>If ever happiness hath lodged with man,</p>

            <p>That day consummate happiness was mine,</p>

            <p>Wide-spreading, steady, calm, contemplative.</p>

            <p>The sun was set, or setting, when I left</p>

            <p>Our cottage door, and evening soon brought on</p>

            <p>A sober hour, not winning or serene,</p>

            <p>For cold and raw the air was, and untuned;</p>

            <p>But as a face we love is sweetest then</p>

            <p>When sorrow damps it, or, whatever look</p>

            <p>It chance to wear, is sweetest if the heart</p>

            <p>Have fullness in herself; even so with me</p>

            <p>It fared that evening. Gently did my soul</p>

            <p>Put off her veil, and, self-transmuted, stood</p>

            <p>Naked, as in the presence of her God.</p>

            <p>While on I walked, a comfort seemed to touch</p>

            <p>A heart that had not been disconsolate:</p>

            <p>Strength came where weakness was not known to
            be,</p>

            <p>At least not felt; and restoration came</p>

            <p>Like an intruder knocking at the door</p>

            <p>Of unacknowledged weariness. I took</p>

            <p>The balance, and with firm hand weighted myself.</p>

            <p>&mdash;Of that external scene which round me
            lay,</p>

            <p>Little, in this abstraction, did I see;</p>

            <p>Remembered less; but I had inward hopes</p>

            <p>And swellings of the spirit, was rapt and
            soothed,</p>

            <p>Conversed with promises, had glimmering views</p>

            <p>How life pervades the undecaying mind;</p>

            <p>How the immortal soul with God-like power</p>

            <p>Informs, creates, and thaws the deepest sleep</p>

            <p>That time can lay upon her; how on earth,</p>

            <p>Man, if he do but live within the light</p>

            <p>Of high endeavors, daily spreads abroad</p>

            <p>His being armed with strength that cannot fail</p>

            <p>Nor was there want of milder thoughts, of love</p>

            <p>Of innocence, and holiday repose;</p>

            <p>And more than pastoral quiet, 'mid the stir</p>

            <p>Of boldest projects, and a peaceful end</p>

            <p>At last, or glorious, by endurance won.</p>

            <p>Thus musing, in a wood I sat me down</p>

            <p>Alone, continuing there to muse: the slopes</p>

            <p>And heights meanwhile were slowly overspread</p>

            <p>With darkness, and before a rippling
            breeze</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page209"
               id="page209"></a>[pg 209]</span>

            <p>The long lake lengthened out its hoary line,</p>

            <p>And in the sheltered coppice where I sat,</p>

            <p>Around me from among the hazel leaves,</p>

            <p>Now here, now there, moved by the straggling
            wind,</p>

            <p>Came ever and anon a breath-like sound,</p>

            <p>Quick as the pantings of the faithful dog,</p>

            <p>The off and on companion of my work;</p>

            <p>And such, at times, believing them to be,</p>

            <p>I turned my head to look if he were there;</p>

            <p>Then into solemn thought I passed once more.</p>

            <p class="i2">A freshness also found I at this time</p>

            <p>In human Life, the daily life of those</p>

            <p>Whose occupations really I loved;</p>

            <p>The peaceful scene oft filled me with surprise,</p>

            <p>Changed like a garden in the heat of spring</p>

            <p>After an eight days' absence. For (to omit</p>

            <p>The things which were the same and yet appeared</p>

            <p>Far otherwise) amid this rural solitude.</p>

            <p>A narrow Vale where each was known to all,</p>

            <p>'Twas not indifferent to a youthful mind</p>

            <p>To mark some sheltering bower or sunny nook,</p>

            <p>Where an old man had used to sit alone,</p>

            <p>Now vacant; pale-faced babes whom I had left</p>

            <p>In arms, now rosy prattlers at the feet</p>

            <p>Of a pleased grandame tottering up and down;</p>

            <p>And growing girls whose beauty, filched away</p>

            <p>With all its pleasant promises, was gone</p>

            <p>To deck some slighted playmate's homely cheek.</p>

            <p class="i2">Yes, I had something of a subtler
            sense,</p>

            <p>And often looking round was moved to smiles</p>

            <p>Such as a delicate work of humor breeds;</p>

            <p>I read, without design, the opinions, thoughts,</p>

            <p>Of those plain-living people now observed</p>

            <p>With clearer knowledge; with another eye</p>

            <p>I saw the quiet woodman in the woods,</p>

            <p>The shepherd roam the hills. With new delight,</p>

            <p>This chiefly, did I note my gray-haired Dame;</p>

            <p>Saw her go forth to church or other work</p>

            <p>Of state, equipped in monumental trim;</p>

            <p>Short velvet cloak, (her bonnet of the like,)</p>

            <p>A mantle such as Spanish Cavaliers</p>

            <p>Wore in old time. Her smooth domestic life,</p>

            <p>Affectionate without disquietude,</p>

            <p>Her talk, her business, pleased me; and no less</p>

            <p>Her clear though sallow stream of piety</p>

            <p>That ran on Sabbath days a fresher course;</p>

            <p>With thoughts unfelt till now I saw her read</p>

            <p>Her Bible on hot Sunday afternoons,</p>

            <p>And loved the book, when she had dropped asleep</p>

            <p>And made of it a pillow for her head.</p>

            <p class="i2">Nor less do I remember to have felt,</p>

            <p>Distinctly manifested at this time,</p>

            <p>A human-heartedness about my love</p>

            <p>For objects hitherto the absolute wealth</p>

            <p>Of my own private being and no more:</p>

            <p>Which I had loved even as a blessed spirit</p>

            <p>Or Angel, if he were to dwell on earth,</p>

            <p>Might love in individual happiness.</p>

            <p>But now there opened on me other thoughts</p>

            <p>Of change, congratulation or regret,</p>

            <p>A pensive feeling! It spread far and wide;</p>

            <p>The trees, the mountains shared it, and the
            brooks,</p>

            <p>The stars of heaven, now seen in their old
            haunts&mdash;</p>

            <p>White Sirius glittering o'er the southern crags,</p>

            <p>Orion with his belt, and those fair Seven,</p>

            <p>Acquaintances of every little child,</p>

            <p>And Jupiter, my own beloved star!</p>

            <p>Whatever shadings of mortality,</p>

            <p>Whatever imports from the world of death</p>

            <p>Had come among these objects heretofore,</p>

            <p>Were, in the main, of mood less tender: strong,</p>

            <p>Deep, gloomy were they, and severe: the
            scatterings</p>

            <p>Of awe or tremulous dread, that had given way</p>

            <p>In latter youth to yearnings of a love</p>

            <p>Enthusiastic, to delight and hope.</p>

            <p class="i2">As one who hangs down-bending from the
            side</p>

            <p>Of a slow-moving boat, upon the breast</p>

            <p>Of a still water, solacing himself</p>

            <p>With such discoveries as his eye can make</p>

            <p>Beneath him in the bottom of the deep,</p>

            <p>Sees many beauteous sights&mdash;weeds, fishes,
            flowers,</p>

            <p>Grots, pebbles, roots of trees, and fancies
            more,</p>

            <p>Yet often is perplexed and cannot part</p>

            <p>The shadow from the substance, rocks and sky</p>

            <p>Mountains and clouds, reflected in the depth</p>

            <p>Of the clear flood, from things which there
            abide</p>

            <p>In their true dwelling; now is crossed by gleam</p>

            <p>Of his own image, by a sunbeam now,</p>

            <p>And wavering motions sent he knows not whence,</p>

            <p>Impediments that make his task more sweet;</p>

            <p>Such pleasant office have we long pursued</p>

            <p>Incumbent o'er the surface of past time</p>

            <p>With like success, nor often have appeared</p>

            <p>Shapes fairer or less doubtfully discerned</p>

            <p>Than those to which the Tale, indulgent Friend!</p>

            <p>Would now direct thy notice. Yet in spite</p>

            <p>Of pleasure won, and knowledge not withheld,</p>

            <p>There was an inner falling off&mdash;I loved,</p>

            <p>Loved deeply all that had been loved before</p>

            <p>More deeply even than ever: but a swarm</p>

            <p>Of heady schemes jostling each other, gawds,</p>

            <p>And feast and dance, and public revelry,</p>

            <p>And sports and games (too grateful in
            themselves,</p>

            <p>Yet in themselves less grateful, I believe,</p>

            <p>Than as they were a badge glossy and fresh</p>

            <p>Of manliness and freedom) all conspired</p>

            <p>To lure my mind from firm habitual quest</p>

            <p>Of feeding pleasures, to depress the zeal</p>

            <p>And damp those yearnings which had once been
            mine&mdash;</p>

            <p>A wild, unworldly-minded youth, given up</p>

            <p>To his own eager thoughts. It would demand</p>

            <p>Some skill, and longer time than may be spared,</p>

            <p>To paint these vanities, and how they wrought</p>

            <p>In haunts where they, till now, had been
            unknown.</p>

            <p>It seemed the very garments that they wore</p>

            <p>Preyed on my strength, and stopped the quiet
            stream</p>

            <p>Of self-forgetfulness.</p>

            <p class="i10">Yes, that heartless chase</p>

            <p>Of trivial pleasures was a poor exchange</p>

            <p>For books and nature at that early age.</p>

            <p>'Tis true, some casual knowledge might be gained</p>

            <p>Of character or life; but at that time,</p>

            <p>Of manners put to school I took small note,</p>

            <p>And all my deeper passions lay elsewhere.</p>

            <p>Far better had it been to exalt the mind</p>

            <p>By solitary study, to uphold</p>

            <p>Intense desire through meditative peace;</p>

            <p>And yet, for chastisement of these regrets,</p>

            <p>The memory of one particular hour</p>

            <p>Doth here rise up against me. 'Mid a throng</p>

            <p>Of maids and youths, old men, and matrons staid,</p>

            <p>A medley of all tempers, I had passed</p>

            <p>The night in dancing, gayety, and mirth,</p>

            <p>With din of instruments and shuffling feet,</p>

            <p>And glancing forms, and tapers glittering,</p>

            <p>And unaimed prattle flying up and down;</p>

            <p>Spirits upon the stretch, and here and there</p>

            <p>Slight shocks of young love-liking interspersed,</p>

            <p>Whose transient pleasure mounted to the head,</p>

            <p>And tingled through the veins. Ere we retired</p>

            <p>The cock had crowed, and now the eastern sky</p>

            <p>Was kindling, not unseen, from humble copse</p>

            <p>And open field, through which the pathway wound,</p>

            <p>And homeward led my steps. Magnificent</p>

            <p>The morning rose, in memorable pomp,</p>

            <p>Glorious as e'er I had beheld&mdash;in front,</p>

            <p>The sea lay laughing at a distance; near,</p>

            <p>The solid mountains shone, bright as the clouds,</p>

            <p>Grain-tinctured, drenched in Empyrean light;</p>

            <p>And in the meadows and the lower grounds</p>

            <p>Was all the sweetness of a common dawn&mdash;</p>

            <p>Dews, vapors, and the melody of birds,</p>

            <p>And laborers going forth to till the fields.</p>

            <p class="i2">Ah! need I say, dear Friend! that to the
            brim</p>

            <p>My heart was full; I made no vows, but vows</p>

            <p>Were then made for me; bond unknown to me</p>

            <p>Was given, that I should be, else sinning
            greatly,</p>

            <p>A dedicated Spirit. On I walked</p>

            <p>In thankful blessedness, which yet survives.</p>

            <p class="i2">Strange rendezvous! My mind was at that
            time</p>

            <p>A parti-colored show of grave and gay,</p>

            <p>Solid and light, short-sighted and profound;</p>

            <p>Of inconsiderate habits and sedate,</p>

            <p>Consorting in one mansion unreproved.</p>

            <p>The worth I knew of powers that I possessed,</p>

            <p>Though slighted and too oft misused. Besides,</p>

            <p>That summer, swarming as it did with thoughts</p>

            <p>Transient and idle, lacked not intervals</p>

            <p>When Folly from the frown of fleeting Time</p>

            <p>Shrunk, and the mind experienced in herself</p>

            <p>Conformity as just as that of old</p>

            <p>To the end and written spirit of God's works,</p>

            <p>Whether held forth in Nature or in Man,</p>

            <p>Through pregnant vision, separate or conjoined.</p>

            <p class="i2">When from our better selves we have too
            long</p>

            <p>Been parted by the hurrying world, and droop,</p>

            <p>Sick of its business, of its pleasure tired,</p>

            <p>How gracious, how benign, is Solitude;</p>

            <p>How potent a mere image of her sway;</p>

            <p>When, for the night deserted, it assumes</p>

            <p>A character of quiet more profound</p>

            <p>Than pathless wastes.</p>

            <p class="i10">Once, when those summer months,</p>

            <p>Where flown, and autumn brought its annual show</p>

            <p>Of oars with oars contending, sails with sails,</p>

            <p>Upon Windander's spacious breast, it chanced</p>

            <p>That&mdash;after I had left a flower-decked room</p>

            <p>(Whose in-door pastime, lighted up, survived</p>

            <p>To a late hour), and spirits overwrought</p>

            <p>Were making night do penance for a day</p>

            <p>Spent in a round of strenuous idleness&mdash;</p>

            <p>My homeward course led up a long ascent,</p>

            <p>Where the road's watery surface, to the top</p>

            <p>Of that sharp rising, glittered to the moon</p>

            <p>And bore the semblance of another stream</p>

            <p>Stealing with silent lapse to join the brook</p>

            <p>That murmured in the vale. All else was still;</p>

            <p>No living thing appeared in earth or air,</p>

            <p>And, save the flowing water's peaceful voice,</p>

            <p>Sound there was none&mdash;but, lo! an uncouth
            shape,</p>

            <p>Shown by a sudden turning of the road,</p>

            <p>So near that, slipping back into the shade</p>

            <p>Of a thick hawthorn, I could mark him well,</p>

            <p>Myself unseen. He was of stature tall,</p>

            <p>A span above man's common measure, tall,</p>

            <p>Stiff, land, and upright; a more meager man</p>

            <p>Was never seen before by night or day.</p>

            <p>Long were his arms, pallid his hands; his mouth</p>

            <p>Looked ghastly in the moonlight: from behind,</p>

            <p>A mile-stone propped him; I could also ken</p>

            <p>That he was clothed in military garb.</p>

            <p>Though faded, yet entire. Companionless,</p>

            <p>No dog attending, by no staff sustained,</p>

            <p>He stood, and in his very dress appeared</p>

            <p>A desolation, a simplicity,</p>

            <p>To which the trappings of a gaudy world</p>

            <p>Make a strange back-ground. From his lips, ere
            long,</p>

            <p>Issued low muttered sounds, as if of pain</p>

            <p>Or some uneasy thought; yet still his form</p>

            <p>Kept the same awful steadiness&mdash;at his feet</p>

            <p>His shadow lay, and moved not. From self-blame</p>

            <p>Not wholly free, I watched him thus; at length</p>

            <p>Subduing my heart's specious cowardice,</p>

            <p>I left the shady nook where I had stood</p>

            <p>And hailed him. Slowly from his resting-place</p>

            <p>He rose, and with a lean and wasted arm</p>

            <p>In measured gesture lifted to his head</p>

            <p>Returned my salutation; then resumed</p>

            <p>His station as before: and when I asked</p>

            <p>His history, the veteran, in reply,</p>

            <p>Was neither slow nor eager; but, unmoved,</p>

            <p>And with a quiet, uncomplaining voice,</p>

            <p>A stately air of mild indifference,</p>

            <p>He told in few plain words a soldier's
            tale&mdash;</p>

            <p>That in the Tropic Islands he had served,</p>

            <p>Whence he had landed scarcely three weeks past;</p>

            <p>That on his landing he had been dismissed,</p>

            <p>And now was traveling toward his native home.</p>

            <p>This heard, I said, in pity, "Come with me."</p>

            <p>He stooped, and straightway from the ground took
            up,</p>

            <p>An oaken staff by me yet unobserved&mdash;</p>

            <p>A staff which must have dropt from his slack
            hand</p>

            <p>And lay till now neglected in the grass.</p>

            <p>Though weak his step and cautious, he appeared</p>

            <p>To travel without pain, and I beheld,</p>

            <p>With an astonishment but ill-suppressed,</p>

            <p>His ghostly figure moving at my side;</p>

            <p>Nor could I, while we journeyed thus, forbear</p>

            <p>To turn from present hardships to the past,</p>

            <p>And speak of war, battle, and pestilence,</p>

            <p>Sprinkling this talk with questions, better
            spared.</p>

            <p>On what he might himself have seen or felt</p>

            <p>He all the while was in demeanor calm.</p>

            <p>Concise in answer: solemn and sublime</p>

            <p>He might have seen, but that in all he said</p>

            <p>There was a strange half-absence, as of one</p>

            <p>Knowing too well the importance of his theme</p>

            <p>But feeling it no longer. Our discourse</p>

            <p>Soon ended, and together on we passed</p>

            <p>In silence through a wood gloomy and still.</p>

            <p>Up-turning, then, along an open field,</p>

            <p>We reached a cottage. At the door I knocked.</p>

            <p>And earnestly to charitable care</p>

            <p>Commended him as a poor friendless man,</p>

            <p>Belated and by sickness overcome.</p>

            <p>Assured that now the traveler would repose</p>

            <p>In comfort, I entreated that henceforth</p>

            <p>He would not linger in the public ways,</p>

            <p>But ask for timely furtherance and help</p>

            <p>Such as his state required. At this reproof,</p>

            <p>With the same ghastly mildness in his look,</p>

            <p>He said, "My trust is in the God of Heaven,</p>

            <p>And in the eye of him who passes me!"</p>

            <p class="i2">The cottage door was speedily
            unbarred,</p>

            <p>And now the soldier touched his hat once more</p>

            <p>With his lean hand, and in a faltering voice,</p>

            <p>Whose tone bespake reviving interests</p>

            <p>Till then unfelt, he thanked me; I returned</p>

            <p>The farewell blessing of the patient man,</p>

            <p>And so we parted. Back I cast a look,</p>

            <p>And lingered near the door a little space,</p>

            <p>Then sought with quiet heart my distant home.</p>

    <h2>THE IVORY MINE:</h2>

    <h3>A TALE OF THE FROZEN SEA.</h3>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h4>VI.&mdash;THE IVORY MINE.</h4>

    <p>The end of so perilous and novel a journey, which must
    necessarily, under the most favorable circumstances, have
    produced more honor than profit, was attained; and yet the
    success of the adventure was doubtful. The season was still too
    cold for any search for fossil ivory, and the first serious
    duty was the erection of a winter residence. Fortunately there
    was an ample supply of logs of wood, some half-rotten, some
    green, lying under the snow on the shores of the bay into which
    the river poured, and which had been deposited there by the
    currents and waves. A regular pile, too, was found, which had
    been laid up by some of the provident natives of New Siberia,
    who, like the Esquimaux, live in the snow. Under this was a
    large supply of frozen fish, which was taken without ceremony,
    the party being near starvation. Of course Sakalar and Ivan
    intended replacing the hoard, if possible, in the short
    summer.</p>

    <p>Wood was made the groundwork of the winter hut which was to
    be erected, but snow and ice formed by far the larger portion
    of the building materials. So hard and compact did the whole
    mass become when finished, and lined with bear-skins and other
    furs, that a huge lamp sufficed for warmth during the day and
    night, and the cooking was done in a small shed by the side.
    The dogs were now set to shift for themselves as to cover, and
    were soon buried in the snow. They were placed on short
    allowance, now they had no work to do, for no one yet knew what
    were the resources of this wild place.</p>

    <p>As soon as the more immediate duties connected with a camp
    had been completed, the whole party occupied themselves with
    preparing traps for foxes, and in other hunting details. A hole
    was broken in the ice in the bay, and this the Kolimsk men
    watched with assiduity for seals. One or two rewarded their
    efforts, but no fish were taken. Sakalar and Ivan, after a day
    or two of repose, started with some carefully-selected dogs in
    search of game, and soon found that the great white bear took
    up his quarters even in that northern latitude. They succeeded
    in killing several, which the dogs dragged home.</p>

    <p>About ten days after their arrival in the great island,
    Sakalar, who was always the first to be moving, roused his
    comrades round him just as a party of a dozen strange men
    appeared in the distance. They were short, stout fellows, with
    long lances in their hands, and by their dress very much
    resembled the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page211"
       id="page211"></a>[pg 211]</span> Esquimaux. Their attitude
       was menacing in the extreme, and by the advice of Sakalar, a
       general volley was fired over their heads. The invaders
       halted, looked confusedly around, and then ran away.
       Firearms retained. therefore, all their pristine qualities
       with these savages.</p>

    <p>"They will return," said Sakalar, moodily; "they did the
    same when I was here before, and then came back and killed my
    friend at night. Sakalar escaped."</p>

    <p>Counsel was now held, and it was determined, after due
    deliberation, that strict watch should be kept at all hours,
    while much was necessarily trusted to the dogs. All day one of
    the party was on the lookout, while at night the hut had its
    entrance well barred. Several days, however, were thus passed
    without molestation, and then Sakalar took the Kolimsk men out
    to hunt, and left Ivan and Kolina together. The young man had
    learned the value of his half-savage friend: her devotion to
    her father and the party generally was unbounded. She murmured
    neither at privations nor at sufferings, and kept up the
    courage of Ivan by painting in glowing terms all his brilliant
    future. She seemed to have laid aside her personal feelings,
    and to look on him only as one doing battle with fortune in the
    hope of earning the hand of the rich widow of Yakoutsk. But
    Ivan was much disposed to gloomy fits; he supposed himself
    forgotten, and slighted, and looked on the time of his
    probation as interminable. It was in this mood that one day he
    was roused from his fit by a challenge from Kolina to go and
    see if the seals had come up to breathe at the hole which every
    morning was freshly broken in the ice. Ivan assented, and away
    they went gaily down to the bay. No seals were there, and after
    a short stay they returned toward the hut, recalled by the
    distant howling of the dogs. But as they came near, they could
    see no sign of men or animals, though the sensible brutes still
    whined under the shelter of their snow-heaps. Ivan, much
    surprised, raised the curtain of the door, his gun in hand,
    expecting to find that some animal was inside. The lamp was
    out, and the hut in total darkness. Before Ivan could recover
    his upright position, four men leaped on him, and he was a
    prisoner.</p>

    <p>Kolina drew back, and cocked her gun; but the natives,
    satisfied with their present prey, formed round Ivan in a
    compact body, tied his hands, and bade him walk. Their looks
    were sufficiently wild and menacing to make him move,
    especially as he recognized them as belonging to the warlike
    party of the Tchouktchas&mdash;a tribe of Siberians who wander
    about the Polar Seas in search of game, who cross Behring's
    Straits in skin-boats, and who probably are the only persons
    who by their temporary sojourn in New Siberia, have caused some
    to suppose it inhabited. Kolina stood uncertain what to do, but
    in a few minutes she roused four of the dogs, and followed.
    Ivan bawled to her to go back, but the girl paid no attention
    to his request, determined, as it seemed, to know his fate.</p>

    <p>The savages hurried Ivan along as rapidly as they could; and
    soon entered a deep and narrow ravine, which about the middle
    parted into two. The narrowest path was selected, and the
    dwelling of the natives soon reached. It was a cavern, the
    narrow entrance of which they crawled through; Ivan followed
    the leader, and soon found himself in a large and wonderful
    cave. It was by nature divided into several compartments, and
    contained a party of twenty men, as many or more women, and
    numerous children. It was warmed in two ways&mdash;by
    wood-fires and grease-lamps, and by a bubbling semi-sulphurous
    spring, that rushed up through a narrow hole, and then fell
    away into a deep well, that carried its warm waters to mingle
    with the icy sea. The acrid smoke escaped by holes in the roof.
    Ivan, his arms and legs bound, was thrust into a separate
    compartment filled with furs, and formed by a projection of the
    rock and the skin-boats which this primitive race employed to
    cross the most stormy seas. He was almost stunned; he lay for a
    while without thought or motion. Gradually he recovered, and
    gazed around; all was night, save above, where by a narrow
    orifice he saw the smoke which hung in clouds around the roof
    escaping. He expected death. He knew the savage race he was
    among, who hated interference with their hunting-grounds, and
    whose fish he and his party had taken. What, therefore, was his
    surprise, when from the summit of the roof, he heard a gentle
    voice whispering in soft accents his own name. His ears must,
    he thought, deceive him. The hubbub close at hand was terrible.
    A dispute was going on. Men, women. and children all joined,
    and yet he had heard the word "Ivan." "Kolina," he replied, in
    equally low but clear tones. As he spoke a knife rolled near
    him. But he could not touch it. Then a dark form filled the
    orifice about a dozen feet above his head, and something moved
    down among projecting stones, and then Kolina stood by him. In
    an instant Ivan was free, and an axe in his hand. The exit was
    before them. Steps were cut in the rock, to ascend to the upper
    entrance, near which Ivan had been placed without fear, because
    tied. But a rush was heard, and the friends had only time to
    throw themselves deeper into the cave, when four men rushed in,
    knife in hand, to immolate the victim. Such had been the
    decision come to after the debate.</p>

    <p>The lamps revealed the escape of the fugitive. A wild cry
    drew all the men together, and then up they scampered along the
    rugged projections, and the barking of the dogs as they fled
    showed that they were in hot and eager chase. Ivan and Kolina
    lost no time. They advanced boldly, knife and hatchet in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page212"
       id="page212"></a>[pg 212]</span> hand, sprang amid the
       terrified women, darted across their horrid cavern, and
       before one of them had recovered from her fright, were in
       the open air. On they ran in the gloom for some distance,
       when they suddenly heard muttering voices. Down they sank
       behind the first large stone, concealing themselves as well
       as they could in the snow. The party moved slowly on toward
       them.</p>

    <p>"I can trace their tracks still," said Sakalar, in a low
    deep tone. "On, while they are alive, or at least for
    vengeance!"</p>

    <p>"Friends!" cried Ivan.</p>

    <p>"Father!" said Kolina, and in an instant the whole party
    were united. Five words were enough to determine Sakalar. The
    whole body rushed back, entered the cavern, and found
    themselves masters of it without a struggle. The women and
    children attempted no resistance. As soon as they were placed
    in a corner, under the guard of the Kolimsk men, a council was
    held. Sakalar, as the most experienced, decided what was to be
    done. He knew the value of threats: one of the women was
    released, and bade go tell the men what had occurred. She was
    to add the offer of a treaty of peace, to which, if both
    parties agreed, the women were to be given up on the one side,
    and the hut and its contents on the other. But the victors
    announced their intention of taking four of the best-looking
    boys as hostages, to be returned whenever they were convinced
    of the good faith of the Tchouktchas. The envoy soon returned,
    agreeing to everything. They had not gone near the hut, fearing
    an ambuscade. The four boys were at once selected, and the
    belligerents separated.</p>

    <p>Sakalar made the little fellows run before, and thus the hut
    was regained. An inner cabin was erected for the prisoners, and
    the dogs placed over them as spies. But as the boys understood
    Sakalar to mean that the dogs were to eat them if they stirred,
    they remained still enough, and made no attempt to run
    away.</p>

    <p>A hasty meal was now cooked, and after its conclusion Ivan
    related the events of the day, warmly dilating on the devotion
    and courage of Kolina, who, with the keenness of a Yakouta, had
    found out his prison by the smoke, and had seen him on the
    ground despite the gloom. Sakalar then explained how, on his
    return, he had been terribly alarmed, and had followed the
    trail on the snow. After mutual congratulations the whole party
    went to sleep.</p>

    <p>The next morning early, the mothers came humbly with
    provisions for their children. They received some trifling
    presents and were sent away in delight. About midday the whole
    tribe presented themselves unarmed, within a short distance of
    the hut, and offered a traffic. They brought a great quantity
    of fish, which they wanted to exchange for tobacco. Sakalar,
    who spoke their language freely, first gave them a roll,
    letting them understand it was in payment of the fish taken
    without leave. This at once dissipated all feelings of
    hostility, and solid peace was insured. So satisfied was
    Sakalar of their sincerity, that he at once released the
    captives.</p>

    <p>From that day the two parties were one, and all thoughts of
    war were completely at an end. A vast deal of bloodshed had
    been prevented by a few concessions on both sides. The same
    result might indeed have been come to by killing half of each
    little tribe, but it is doubtful if the peace would have been
    as satisfactory to the survivors.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h4>VII.&mdash;THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN.</h4>

    <p>Occupied with the chase, with bartering, and with conversing
    with their new friends, the summer gradually came around. The
    snow melted, the hills became a series of cascades, in every
    direction water poured toward the sea. But the hut remained
    solid and firm, a little earth only being cast over the snow.
    Flocks of ducks and geese soon appeared, a slight vegetation
    was visible, and the sea was in motion. But what principally
    drew all eyes were the vast heaps of fossil ivory exposed to
    view on the banks of the stream, laid bare more and more every
    year by the torrents of spring. A few days sufficed to collect
    a heap greater than they could take away on the sledges in a
    dozen journeys. Ivan gazed at his treasure in mute despair.
    Were all that at Yakoutsk, he was the richest merchant in
    Siberia; but to take it thither seemed impossible. But in
    stepped the adventurous Tchouktchas. They offered, for a
    stipulated sum in tobacco and other valuables, to land a large
    portion of the ivory at a certain spot on the shores of
    Siberia, by means of their boats. Ivan, though again surprised
    at the daring of these wild men, accepted the proposal, and
    engaged to give them his whole stock. The matter was then
    settled, and our adventurers and their new friends dispersed to
    their summer avocations.</p>

    <p>These consisted in fishing and hunting, and repairing boats
    and sledges. Their canoes were made of skins and whalebone, and
    bits of wood; but they were large, and capable of sustaining
    great weight. They proposed to start as soon as the ice was
    broken up, and to brave all the dangers of so fearful a
    navigation. They were used to impel themselves along in every
    open space, and to take shelter on icebergs from danger. When
    one of these icy mountains went in the right direction, they
    stuck to it; but at others they paddled away, amid dangers of
    which they seemed wholly unconscious.</p>

    <p>A month was taken up in fishing, in drying the fish, or in
    putting it in holes where there was eternal frost. An immense
    stock was laid in: and then one morning the Tchouktchas took
    their departure, and the adventurers remained alone. Their hut
    was broken up, and all made ready for their second journey. The
    sledges were enlarged, to bear the heaviest possible load at
    starting. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page213"
       id="page213"></a>[pg 213]</span> A few days' overloading
       were not minded, as the provisions would soon decrease.
       Still not half so much could be taken as they wished, and
       yet Ivan had nearly a ton of ivory, and thirty tons was the
       greatest produce of any one year in all Siberia.</p>

    <p>But the sledges were ready long before the sea was so. The
    interval was spent in continued hunting, to prevent any
    consumption of the traveling store. All were heartily tired,
    long before it was over, of a day nearly as long as two English
    months. Soon the winter set in with intense rigor; the sea
    ceased to toss and heave; the icebergs and fields moved more
    and more slowly; at last ocean and land were blended into
    one&mdash;the night of a month came, and the sun was seen no
    more.</p>

    <p>The dogs were now roused up; the sledges harnessed; and the
    instant the sea was firm enough to sustain them, the party
    started. Sakalar's intention was to try forced marches in a
    straight line. Fortune favored them. Not an accident occurred
    for days. At first they did not move exactly in the same
    direction as when they came, but they soon found traces of
    their previous journey, proving that a plain of ice had been
    forced away at least fifty miles during the thaw.</p>

    <p>The road was now again rugged and difficult, firing was
    getting scarce, the dogs were devouring the fish with rapidity,
    and only one half the ocean-journey was over. But on they
    pushed with desperate energy, each eye once more keenly on the
    look-out for game. Every one drove his team in sullen silence,
    for all were on short allowance, and all were hungry. They sat
    on what was to them more valuable than gold, and yet they had
    not what was necessary for subsistence. The dogs were urged
    every day to the utmost limits of their strength. But so much
    space had been taken up by the ivory, that at last there
    remained neither food nor fuel. None knew at what distance they
    were from the shore, and their position seemed desperate. There
    were even whispers of killing some of the dogs; and Sakalar and
    Ivan were upbraided for the avarice which had brought them to
    such straits.</p>

    <p>"See!" said the old hunter suddenly, with a delighted smile,
    pointing toward the south.</p>

    <p>The whole party looked eagerly. A thick column of smoke rose
    in the air at no very considerable distance. This was the
    signal agreed on with the Tchouktchas, who were to camp where
    there was plenty of wood.</p>

    <p>Every hand was raised to urge on the dogs to this point, and
    at last, from the summit of a hill of ice they saw the shore
    and the blaze of the fire. The wind was toward them, and the
    atmosphere heavy. The dogs smelled the distant camp, and darted
    almost recklessly forward. At last they sank near to the
    Tchouktcha huts, panting and exhausted.</p>

    <p>Their allies of the spring were true; they gave them food,
    of which both man and beast ate greedily, and then sought
    repose. The Tchouktchas had then formed their journey with
    wonderful success and rapidity, and had found time to lay in a
    pretty fair stock of fish. This they freely shared with Ivan
    and his party, and were delighted when he abandoned to them all
    his tobacco and rum, and part of his tea.</p>

    <p>The Tchouktchas had been four years absent in their
    wanderings, and were eager to get home once more to the land of
    the reindeer, and to their friends. They were perhaps the
    greatest travelers of a tribe noted for its facility of
    locomotion. And so, with warm expressions of esteem and
    friendship on both sides, the two parties separated&mdash;the
    men of the east making their way on foot, toward the Straits of
    Behring.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <h4>VIII.&mdash;THE VOYAGE HOME.</h4>

    <p>Under considerable disadvantages did Sakalar, Ivan, and
    their friends prepare for the conclusion of their journey.
    Their provisions were very scanty, and their only hope of
    replenishing their stores was on the banks of the Vchivaya
    River, which being in some places pretty rapid might not be
    frozen over. Sakalar and his friends determined to strike out
    in a straight line. Part of the ivory had to be concealed and
    abandoned, to be fetched another time; but as their stock of
    provisions was so small, they were able to take the principal
    part. It had been resolved, after some debate, to make in a
    direct line for the Vchivaya river, and thence to
    Vijnei-Kolimsk. The road was of a most difficult, and, in part,
    unknown character; but it was imperative to move in as straight
    a direction as possible. Time was the great enemy they had to
    contend with, because their provisions were sufficient for a
    limited period only.</p>

    <p>The country was at first level enough, and the dogs, after
    their rest, made sufficiently rapid progress. At night they had
    reached the commencement of a hilly region, while in the
    distance could be seen pretty lofty mountains. According to a
    plan decided on from the first, the human members of the party
    were placed at once on short allowance, while the dogs received
    as much food as could be reasonably given. At early dawn the
    tent was struck, and the dogs were impelled along the banks of
    a small river completely frozen. Indeed, after a short
    distance, it was taken as the smoothest path. But at the end of
    a dozen miles they found themselves in a narrow gorge between
    two hills; at the foot of a once foaming cataract, now hard
    frozen. It was necessary to retreat some miles, and gain the
    land once more. The only path which was now found practicable
    was along the bottom of some pretty steep rocks. But the track
    got narrower and narrower, until the dogs were drawing along
    the edge of a terrific precipice with not four feet of holding.
    All alighted, and led the dogs, for a false step was death.
    Fortunately the path became no narrower, and in one place it
    widened out and made a sort of hollow. Here a bitter blast,
    almost strong enough to cast them from their feet, checked
    further progress, and on that naked spot, under a projecting
    mass of stone, without fire, did the whole party halt.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"
       id="page214"></a>[pg 214]</span> Men and dogs huddled
       together for warmth, and all dined on raw and frozen fish. A
       few hours of sleep, however, were snatched; and then, as the
       storm abated, they again advanced. The descent was soon
       reached, and led into a vast plain without tree or bush. A
       range of snow-clad hills lay before them, and through a
       narrow gully between two mountains was the only practicable
       pathway. But all hearts were gladdened by the welcome sight
       of some <i>argali</i>, or Siberian sheep, on the slope of a
       hill. These animals are the only winter game, bears, and
       wolves excepted. Kolina was left with the dogs, and the rest
       started after the animals, which were pawing in the snow for
       some moss or half-frozen herbs. Every caution was used to
       approach them against the wind, and a general volley soon
       sent them scampering away to the mountain-tops, leaving
       three behind.</p>

    <p>But Ivan saw that he had wounded another, and away he went
    in chase. The animal ascended a hill, and then halted. But
    seeing a man coming quickly after him, it turned and fled down
    the opposite side. Ivan was instantly after him. The descent
    was steep, but the hunter saw only the argili, and darted down.
    He slid rather than ran with fearful rapidity, and passed the
    sheep by, seeking to check himself too late. A tremendous gulf
    was before him, and his eyes caught an instant glance of a deep
    distant valley. Then he saw no more until he found himself
    lying still. He had sunk, on the very brink of the precipice,
    into a deep snow bank formed by some projecting rock, and had
    only thus been saved from instant death. Deeply grateful, Ivan
    crept cautiously up the hill-side, though not without his
    prize, and rejoined his companions.</p>

    <p>The road now offered innumerable difficulties, it was rough
    and uneven&mdash;now hard, now soft. They made but slow
    progress for the next three days, while their provisions began
    to draw to an end. They had at least a dozen days more before
    them. All agreed that they were now in the very worst
    difficulty they had been in. That evening they dined on the
    last meal of mutton and fish; they were at the foot of a lofty
    hill, which they determined to ascend while strength was left.
    The dogs were urged up the steep ascent, and after two hours'
    toil, they reached the summit. It was a table-land, bleak and
    miserable, and the wind was too severe to permit camping. On
    they pushed, and camped a little way down its sides.</p>

    <p>The next morning the dogs had no food, while the men had
    nothing but large draughts of warm tea. But it was impossible
    to stop. Away they hurried, after deciding that, if nothing
    turned up the next morning, two or three of the dogs must be
    killed to save the rest. Little was the ground they got over,
    with hungry beasts and starving men, and all were glad to halt
    near a few dried larches. Men and dogs eyed each other
    suspiciously, The animals, sixty-four in number, had they not
    been educated to fear man, would have soon settled the matter.
    But there they lay, panting and faint&mdash;to start up
    suddenly with a fearful howl. A bear was on them. Sakalar
    fired, and then in rushed the dogs, savage and fierce. It was
    worse than useless, it was dangerous, for the human beings of
    the party to seek to share this windfall. It was enough that
    the dogs had found something to appease their hunger.</p>

    <p>Sakalar, however, knew that his faint and weary companions
    could not move the next day if tea alone were their sustenance
    that night. He accordingly put in practice one of the devices
    of his woodcraft. The youngest of the larches was cut down, and
    the coarse outside bark was taken off. Then every atom of the
    soft bark was peeled off the tree, and being broken into small
    pieces, was cast into the boiling pot, already full of water.
    The quantity was great, and made a thick substance. Round this
    the whole party collected, eager for the moment when they could
    fall to. But Sakalar was cool and methodical even in that
    terrible hour. He took a spoon, and quietly skimmed the pot, to
    take away the resin that rose to the surface. Then gradually
    the bark melted away, and presently the pot was filled by a
    thick paste, and looked not unlike glue. All gladly ate, and
    found it nutritive, pleasant, and warm. They felt satisfied
    when the meal was over, and were glad to observe that the dogs
    returned to the camp completely satisfied also, which, under
    the circumstances, was matter of great gratification.</p>

    <p>In the morning, after another mess of larch-bark soup, and
    after a little tea, the adventurers again advanced on their
    journey. They were now in an arid, bleak, and terrible plain of
    vast extent. Not a tree, not a shrub, not an elevation was to
    be seen. Starvation was again staring them in the face, and no
    man knew when this dreadful plain would end. That night the
    whole party cowered in their tent without fire, content to chew
    a few tea-leaves preserved from the last meal. Serious thoughts
    were now entertained of abandoning their wealth in that wild
    region. But as none pressed the matter very hardly, the ledges
    were harnessed again next morning, and the dogs driven on. But
    man and beast were at the last gasp, and not ten miles were
    traversed that day, the end of which brought them to a large
    river, on the borders of which were some trees. Being wide and
    rapid, it was not frozen, and there was still hope, The seine
    was drawn from a sledge, and taken into the water. It was
    fastened from one side to another of a narrow gut, and there
    left. It was of no avail examining it until morning, for the
    fish only come out at night.</p>

    <p>There was not a man of the party who had his exact sense
    about him, while the dogs lay panting on the snow, their
    tongues hanging out, their eyes glaring with almost savage
    fury. The trees round the bank were large and dry, and not one
    had an atom of soft <span class="pagenum"><a name="page215"
       id="page215"></a>[pg 215]</span> bark on it. All the
       resource they had was to drink huge draughts of tea, and
       then seek sleep. Sakalar set the example, and the Kolimsk
       men, to whom such scenes were not new, followed his advice;
       but Ivan walked up and down before the tent. A huge fire had
       been made, which was amply fed by the wood of the river
       bank, and it blazed on high, showing in bold relief the
       features of the scene. Ivan gazed vacantly at everything;
       but he saw not the dark and glancing river&mdash;he saw not
       the bleak plain of snow&mdash;his eyes looked not on the
       romantic picture of the tent and its bivouac-fire: his
       thoughts were on one thing alone. He it was who had brought
       them to that pass, and on his head rested all the misery
       endured by man and beast, and, worst of all, by the good and
       devoted Kolina.</p>

    <p>There she sat, too, on the ground, wrapped in her warm
    clothes, her eyes, fixed on the crackling logs. Of what was she
    thinking? Whatever occupied her mind, it was soon chased away
    by the sudden speech of Ivan. "Kolina," said he, in a tone
    which borrowed a little of intensity from the state of mind in
    which hunger had placed all of them, "canst thou ever forgive
    me?"</p>

    <p>"What?" replied the young girl softly.</p>

    <p>"My having brought you here to die, far away from your
    native hills?"</p>

    <p>"Kolina cares little for herself," said the Yakouta maiden,
    rising and speaking perhaps a little wildly; "let her father
    escape, and she is willing to lie near the tombs of the old
    people on the borders of the icy sea."</p>

    <p>"But Ivan had hoped to see for Kolina many bright, happy
    days; for Ivan would have made her father rich, and Kolina
    would have been the richest unmarried girl in the plain of
    Miouré!"</p>

    <p>"And would riches make Kolina happy?" said she sadly.</p>

    <p>"Young girl of the Yakouta, hearken to me! Let Ivan live or
    die this hour; Ivan is a fool. He left home and comfort to
    cross the icy seas in search of wealth, and to gain happiness;
    but if he had only had eyes, he would have stopped at Miouré.
    There he saw a girl, lively as the heaven-fire in the north,
    good, generous, kind; and she was an old friend, and might have
    loved Ivan; but the man of Yakoutsk was blind, and told her of
    his passion for a selfish widow, and the Yakouta maiden never
    thought of Ivan but as a brother!"</p>

    <p>"What means Ivan?" asked Kolina, trembling with emotion.</p>

    <p>"Ivan has long meant, when he came to the yourte of Sakalar,
    to lay his wealth at his feet, and beg of his old friend to
    give him his child: but Ivan now fears that he may die, and
    wishes to know what would have been the answer of Kolina?"</p>

    <p>"But Maria Vorotinska?" urged the girl, who seemed
    dreaming.</p>

    <p>"Has long been forgotten. How could I not love my old
    playmate and friend! Kolina&mdash;Kolina, listen to Ivan!
    Forget his love for the widow of Yakoutsk, and Ivan will stay
    in the plain of Vchivaya and die."</p>

    <p>"Kolina is very proud," whispered the girl, sitting down on
    a log near the fire, and speaking in a low tone; "and Kolina
    thinks yet that the friend of her father has forgotten himself.
    But if he be not wild, if the sufferings of the journey have
    not made him say that which is not, Kolina would be very
    happy."</p>

    <p>"Be plain, girl of Miouré&mdash;maiden of the Yakouta tribe!
    and play not with the heart of a man. Can Kolina take Ivan as
    her husband?"</p>

    <p>A frank and happy reply gave the Yakoutsk merchant all the
    satisfaction he could wish; and then followed several hours of
    those sweet and delightful explanations which never end between
    young lovers when first they have acknowledged their mutual
    affection. They had hitherto concealed so much, that there was
    much to tell; and Ivan and Kolina, who for nearly three years
    had lived together, with a bar between their deep but concealed
    affection, seemed to have no end of words. Ivan had begun to
    find his feelings change from the very hour Sakalar's daughter
    volunteered to accompany him, but it was only in the cave of
    New Siberia that his heart had been completely won.</p>

    <p>So short, and quiet, and sweet were the hours, that the time
    of rest passed by without the thought of sleep. Suddenly,
    however, they were roused to a sense of their situation, and
    leaving their wearied and exhausted companions still asleep,
    they moved with doubt and dread to the water's side. Life was
    now doubly dear to both, and their fancy painted the coming
    forth of an empty net as the termination of all hope. But the
    net came heavily and slowly to land. It was full of fish. They
    were on the well-stocked Vchivaya. More than three hundred
    fish, small and great, were drawn on shore; and then they
    recast the net.</p>

    <p>"Up, man and beast!" thundered Ivan, as, after selecting two
    dozen of the finest, he abandoned the rest to the dogs.</p>

    <p>The animals, faint and weary, greedily seized on the food
    given them, while Sakalar and the Kolimsk men could scarcely
    believe their senses. The hot coals were at once brought into
    requisition, and the party were soon regaling themselves on a
    splendid meal of tea and broiled fish. I should alarm my
    readers did I record the quantities eaten. An hour later, every
    individual was a changed being, but most of all the lovers.
    Despite their want of rest, they looked fresher than any of the
    party. It was determined to camp at least twenty hours more in
    that spot; and the Kolimsk men declared that the river must be
    the Vchivaya, they could draw the seine all day, for the river
    was deep, its waters warmer than others, and its abundance of
    fish such as to border on the fabulous. They went accordingly
    down to the side of the stream, and then the happy Kolina gave
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page216"
       id="page216"></a>[pg 216]</span> free vent to her joy. She
       burst out into a song of her native land, and gave way to
       some demonstrations of delight, the result of her earlier
       education, that astonished Sakalar. But when he heard that
       during that dreadful night he had found a son, Sakalar
       himself almost lost his reason. The old man loved Ivan
       almost as much as his own child, and when he saw the youth
       in his yourte on his hunting trips, had formed some project
       of the kind now brought about; but the confessions of Ivan
       on his last visit to Miouré had driven all such thoughts
       away.</p>

    <p>"Art in earnest, Ivan?" said he, after a pause of some
    duration.</p>

    <p>"In earnest!" exclaimed Ivan, laughing; "why, I fancy the
    young men of Miouré will find me so, if they seek to question
    my right to Kolina!"</p>

    <p>Kolina smiled, and looked happy; and the old hunter heartily
    blessed his children, adding that the proudest, dearest hope of
    his heart was now within probable realization.</p>

    <p>The predictions of the Kolimsk men were realized. The river
    gave them as much fish as they needed for their journey home;
    and as now Sakalar knew his way, there was little fear for the
    future. An ample stock was piled on the sledges, the dogs had
    unlimited feeding for two days, and then away they sped toward
    an upper part of the river, which, being broad and shallow, was
    no doubt frozen on the surface. They found it as they expected,
    and even discovered that the river was gradually freezing all
    the way down. But little caring for this now, on they went, and
    after considerable fatigue and some delay, arrived at Kolimsk,
    to the utter astonishment of all the inhabitants, who had long
    given them up for lost.</p>

    <p>Great rejoicings took place. The friends of the three
    Kolimsk men gave a grand festival, in which the rum, and
    tobacco, and tea, which had been left at the place for payment
    for their journey, played a conspicuous part. Then, as it was
    necessary to remain here some time, while the ivory was brought
    from a deposit near the sea, Ivan and Kolina were married.
    Neither of them seemed to credit the circumstance, even when
    fast tied by the Russian church. It had come so suddenly, so
    unexpectedly on both, that their heads could not quite make the
    affair out. But they were married in right down earnest, and
    Kolina was a proud and happy woman. The enormous mass of ivory
    brought to Kolimsk excited the attention of a distinguished
    exile, who drew up a statement in Ivan's name, and prepared it
    for transmission to the White Czar, as the emperor is called in
    these parts.</p>

    <p>When summer came, the young couple, with Sakalar and a
    caravan of merchants, started for Yakoutsk, Ivan being by far
    the richest and most important member of the party. After a
    single day's halt at Miouré, on they went to the town, and made
    their triumphal entry in September. Ivan found Maria Vorotinska
    a wife and mother, and his vanity was not much wounded by the
    falsehood. The <i>ci-devant</i> widow was a little astonished
    at Ivan's return, and particularly at his treasure of ivory:
    but she received his wife with politeness, a little tempered by
    her sense of her own superiority to a savage, as she designated
    Kolina to her friends in a whisper. But Kolina was so gentle,
    so pretty, so good, so cheerful, so happy, that she found her
    party at once, and the two ladies became rival leaders of the
    fashion.</p>

    <p>This lasted until the next year, when a messenger from the
    capital brought a letter to Ivan from the emperor himself,
    thanking him for his narrative, sending him a rich present, his
    warm approval, and the office of first civil magistrate in the
    city of Yakoutsk. This turned the scales wholly on one side,
    and Maria bowed low to Kolina. But Kolina had no feelings of
    the parvenu, and she was always a general favorite. Ivan
    accepted with pride his sovereign's favor, and by dint of
    assiduity, soon learned to be a useful magistrate. He always
    remained a good husband, a good father, and a good son, for he
    made the heart of old Sakalar glad. He never regretted his
    journey: he always declared he owed to it wealth and happiness,
    a high position in society, and an admirable wife. Great
    rejoicings took place many years after in Yakoutsk, at the
    marriage of the son of Maria, united to the daughter of Ivan,
    and from the first unto the last, none of the parties concerned
    ever had reason to mourn over the perilous journey in search of
    the Ivory Mine.</p>
    <hr class="short" />

    <p>For the information of the non-scientific, it may be
    necessary to mention that the ivory alluded to in the preceding
    tale, is derived from the tusks of the mammoth, or fossil
    elephant of the geologist. The remains of this gigantic
    quadruped are found all over the northern hemisphere, from the
    40th to the 75th degree of latitude: but most abundantly in the
    region which lies between the mountains of Central Asia and the
    shores and islands of the Frozen Sea. So profusely do they
    exist in this region, that the tusks have for more than a
    century constituted an important article of
    traffic&mdash;furnishing a large proportion of the ivory
    required by the carver and turner. The remains lie imbedded in
    the upper tertiary clays and gravels; and these, by exposure to
    the river-currents, to the waves of the sea, and other erosive
    agencies, are frequently swept away during the thaws of summer,
    leaving tusks and bones in masses, and occasionally even entire
    skeletons, in a wonderful state of preservation. The most
    perfect specimen yet obtained, and from the study of which the
    zoologist has been enabled to arrive at an accurate knowledge
    of the structure and habits of the mammoth, is that discovered
    by a Tungusian fisherman, near the mouth of the river Lena, in
    the summer of 1799.</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page217"
       id="page217"></a>[pg 217]</span>

    <p>Being in the habit of collecting tusks among the debris of
    the gravel-cliffs, (for it is generally at a considerable
    elevation in the cliffs and river banks that the remains
    occur,) he observed a strange shapeless mass projecting from an
    ice-bank some fifty or sixty feet above the river; during next
    summer's thaw he saw the same object, rather more disengaged
    from amongst the ice; in 1801 he could distinctly perceive the
    tusk and flank of an immense animal; and in 1803, in
    consequence of an earlier and more powerful thaw, the huge
    carcase became entirely disengaged, and fell on the sandbank
    beneath. In the spring of the following year the fisherman cut
    off the tusks, which he sold for fifty rubles (£7, 10s.;) and
    two years afterward, our countryman, Mr. Adams, visited the
    spot, and gives the following account of the extraordinary
    phenomenon:</p>

    <p>"At this time I found the mammoth still in the same place,
    but altogether mutilated. The discoverer was contented with his
    profit for the tusks, and the Yakoutski of the neighborhood had
    cut off the flesh, with which they fed their dogs. During the
    scarcity, wild beasts, such as white bears, wolves, wolverines,
    and foxes, also fed upon it, and the traces of their footsteps
    were seen around. The skeleton, almost entirely cleared of its
    flesh, remained whole, with the exception of a foreleg. The
    head was covered with a dry skin; one of the ears, well
    preserved, was furnished with a tuft of hair. All these parts
    have necessarily been injured in transporting them a distance
    of 7,330 miles, (to the Imperial museum of St. Petersburgh,)
    but the eyes have been preserved, and the pupil of one can
    still be distinguished. The mammoth was a male, with a long
    mane on the neck. The tail and proboscis were not preserved.
    The skin, of which I possess three-fourths, is of a dark-gray
    color, covered with a reddish wool and black hairs: but the
    dampness of the spot where it had lain so long had in some
    degree destroyed the hair. The entire carcase, of which I
    collected the bones on the spot, was nine feet four inches
    high, and sixteen feet four inches long, without including the
    tusks, which measured nine feet six inches along the curve. The
    distance from the base or root of the tusk to the point is
    three feet seven inches. The two tusks together weighed three
    hundred and sixty pounds, English weight, and the head alone
    four hundred and fourteen pounds. The skin was of such weight
    that it required ten persons to transport it to the shore; and
    after having cleared the ground, upward of thirty-six pounds of
    hair were collected, which the white bears had trodden while
    devouring the flesh."</p>

    <p>Since then, other carcases of elephants have been
    discovered, in a greater or less degree of preservation; as
    also the remains of rhinoceroses, mastodons, and allied
    pachyderms&mdash;the mammoth more abundantly in the old world,
    the mastodon in the new. In every case these animals differ
    from existing species: are of more gigantic dimensions; and,
    judging from their natural coverings of thick-set curly-crisped
    wool and strong hair, upward of a foot in length, were fitted
    to live, if not in a boreal, at least in a coldly-temperate
    region. Indeed, there is proof positive of the then more milder
    climate of these regions in the discovery of pine and
    birch-trunks where no vegetation now flourishes; and further,
    in the fact that fragments of pine-leaves, birch-twigs, and
    other northern plants, have been detected between the grinders
    and within the stomachs of these animals. We have thus
    evidence, that at the close of the tertiary, and shortly after
    the commencement of the current epoch, the northern hemisphere
    enjoyed a much milder climate; that it was the abode of huge
    pachyderms now extinct; that a different distribution of sea
    and land prevailed; and that on a new distribution or sea and
    land, accompanied also by a different relative level, these
    animals died away, leaving their remains imbedded in the clays,
    gravels, and other alluvial deposits, where, under the
    antiseptic influence of an almost eternal frost, many of them
    have been preserved as entire as at the fatal moment they sank
    under the rigors of external conditions no longer fitted for
    their existence. It has been attempted by some to prove the
    adaptability of these animals to the present conditions of the
    northern hemisphere; but so untenable in every phase is this
    opinion, that it would be sheer waste of time and space to
    attempt its refutation. That they may have migrated northward
    and southward with the seasons is more than probable, though it
    has been stated that the remains diminish in size the farther
    north they are found; but that numerous herds of such huge
    animals should have existed in these regions at all, and that
    for thousands of years, presupposes an exuberant arboreal
    vegetation, and the necessary degree of climate for its growth
    and development. It has been mentioned that the mastodon and
    mammoth seem to have attained their meridian toward the close
    of the tertiary epoch, and that a few may have lived even in
    the current era; but it is more probable that the commencement
    of existing conditions was the proximate cause of their
    extinction, and that not a solitary specimen ever lived to be
    the contemporary of man.</p>

    <h2>A MIGHTIER HUNTER THAN NIMROD.</h2>

    <p>A great deal has been said about the prowess of Nimrod, in
    connection with the chase, from the days of him of Babylon to
    those of the late Mr. Apperley of Shropshire; but we question
    whether, among all the sporting characters mentioned in ancient
    or modern story, there ever was so mighty a hunter as the
    gentleman whose sporting calendar now lies before
    us.<a id="footnotetag4"
       name="footnotetag4"></a><a href="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a>
       The annals of the chase, so far as we are acquainted with
       them, supply no such instances of familiar intimacy with
       lions, elephants, hippopotami, rhinoceroses, serpents,
       crocodiles, and other furious animals, with which the human
       species in general is not very forward in cultivating an
       acquaintance.</p>

    <p>Mr. Cumming had exhausted the deer-forests of his native
    Scotland; he had sighed for the rolling prairies and rocky
    mountains of the Far West, and was tied down to military
    routine as a mounted rifleman in the Cape Colony; when he
    determined to resign his commission into the hands of
    Government, and himself to the delights of hunting amid the
    untrodden plains and forests of South Africa. Having provided
    himself with wagons to travel and live in, with bullocks to
    draw them, and with a host of attendants; a sufficiency of
    arms, horses, dogs, and ammunition, he set out from
    Graham's-Town in October, 1843. From that period his hunting
    adventures extended over five years, during which time he
    penetrated from various points and in various directions from
    his starting-place in lat. 33 down to lat. 20, and passed
    through districts upon which no European foot ever before trod;
    regions where the wildest of wild animals abound&mdash;nothing
    less serving Mr. Cumming's ardent purpose.</p>

    <p>A lion story in the early part of his book will introduce
    this fearless hunter-author to our readers better than the most
    elaborate dissection of his character. He is approaching
    Colesberg, the northernmost military station belonging to the
    Cape Colony. He is on a trusty steed, which he calls also
    "Colesberg." Two of his attendants on horseback are with him.
    "Suddenly," says the author, "I observed a number of vultures
    seated on the plain about a quarter of a mile ahead of us, and
    close beside them stood a huge lioness, consuming a blesblok
    which she had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page219"
       id="page219"></a>[pg 219]</span> killed. She was assisted in
       her repast by about a dozen jackals, which were feasting
       along with her in the most friendly and confidential manner.
       Directing my followers' attention to the spot, I remarked,
       'I see the lion;' to which they replied, 'Whar? whar? Yah!
       Almagtig! dat is he;' and instantly reining in their steeds
       and wheeling about, they pressed their heels to their
       horses' sides, and were preparing to betake themselves to
       flight. I asked them what they were going to do? To which
       they answered, 'We have not yet placed caps on our rifles.'
       This was true; but while this short conversation was
       passing, the lioness had observed us. Raising her full round
       face, she overhauled us for a few seconds, and then set off
       at a smart canter toward a range of mountains some miles to
       the northward; the whole troop of jackals also started off
       in another direction; there was therefore no time to think
       of caps. The first move was to bring her to bay, and not a
       second was to be lost. Spurring my good and lively steed,
       and shouting to my men to follow, I flew across the plain,
       and, being fortunately mounted on Colesberg, the flower of
       my stud, I gained upon her at every stride. This was to me a
       joyful moment, and I at once made up my mind that she or I
       must die. The lioness soon after suddenly pulled up, and sat
       on her haunches like a dog, with her back toward me, not
       even deigning to look round. She then appeared to say to
       herself, 'Does this fellow know who he is after?' Having
       thus sat for half a minute, as if involved in thought, she
       sprang to her feet, and facing about, stood looking at me
       for a few seconds, moving her tail slowly from side to side,
       showing her teeth and growling fiercely. She next made a
       short run forward, making a loud, rumbling noise like
       thunder. This she did to intimidate me; but finding that I
       did not flinch an inch, nor seem to heed her hostile
       demonstrations, she quietly stretched out her massive arms,
       and lay down on the grass. My Hottentots now coming up, we
       all three dismounted, and drawing our rifles from their
       holsters, we looked to see if the powder was up in the
       nipples, and put on our caps. While this was doing, the
       lioness sat up, and showed evident symptoms of uneasiness.
       She looked first at us, and then behind her, as if to see if
       the coast were clear; after which she made a short run
       toward us, uttering her deep-drawn murderous growls. Having
       secured the three horses to one another by their rheims, we
       led them on as if we intended to pass her, in the hope of
       obtaining a broadside; but this she carefully avoided to
       expose, presenting only her full front. I had given Stofolus
       my Moore rifle, with orders to shoot her if she should
       spring upon me, but on no account to fire before me.
       Kleinboy was to stand ready to hand me my Purdey rifle, in
       case the two-grooved Dixon should not prove sufficient. My
       men as yet had been steady, but they were in a precious
       stew, their faces having assumed a ghastly paleness; and I
       had a painful feeling that I could place no reliance on
       them. Now, then, for it, neck or nothing! She is within
       sixty yards of us, and she keeps advancing. We turned the
       horses' tails to her. I knelt on one side, and taking a
       steady aim at her breast, let fly. The ball cracked loudly
       on her tawny hide, and crippled her in the shoulder; upon
       which she charged with an appalling roar, and in the
       twinkling of an eye she was in the midst of us. At this
       moment Stofolus'a rifle exploded in his hand, and Kleinboy,
       whom I had ordered to stand ready by me, danced about like a
       duck in a gale of wind. The lioness sprang upon Colesberg,
       and fearfully lacerated his ribs and haunches with her
       horrid teeth and claws. The worst wound was on his haunch,
       which exhibited a sickening, yawning gash, more than twelve
       inches long, almost laying bare the very bone. I was very
       cool and steady, and did not feel in the least degree
       nervous, having fortunately great confidence in my own
       shooting; but I must confess, when the whole affair was
       over, I felt that it was a very awful situation, and
       attended with extreme peril, as I had no friend with me on
       whom I could rely. When the lioness sprang on Colesberg, I
       stood out from the horses, ready with my second barrel for
       the first chance she should give me of a clear shot. This
       she quickly did; for, seemingly satisfied with the revenge
       she had now taken, she quitted Colesberg, and slewing her
       tail to one side, trotted sulkily past within a few paces of
       me, taking one step to the left. I pitched my rifle to my
       shoulder, and in another second the lioness was stretched on
       the plain a lifeless corpse."</p>

    <p>This is, however, but a harmless adventure compared with a
    subsequent escapade&mdash;not with one, but with six lions. It
    was the hunter's habit to lay wait near the drinking-places of
    these animals, concealed in a hole dug for the purpose. In such
    a place on the occasion in question, Mr. Cumming&mdash;having
    left one of three rhinoceroses he had previously killed as a
    bait&mdash;ensconsed himself. Such a savage festival as that
    which introduced the adventure, has never before, we believe,
    been introduced through the medium of the softest English and
    the finest hot-pressed paper to the notice of the civilized
    public. "Soon after twilight," the author relates, "I went down
    to my hole with Kleinboy and two natives, who lay concealed in
    another hole, with Wolf and Boxer ready to slip, in the event
    of wounding a lion. On reaching the water I looked toward the
    carcase of the rhinoceros, and, to my astonishment, I beheld
    the ground alive with large creatures, as though a troop of
    zebras were approaching the fountain to drink. Kleinboy
    remarked to me that a troop of zebras were standing on the
    height. I answered, 'Yes,' but I knew very well that zebras
    would not be capering around the carcase of a rhinoceros. I
    quickly <span class="pagenum"><a name="page220"
       id="page220"></a>[pg 220]</span> arranged my blankets,
       pillow, and guns in the hole, and then lay down to feast my
       eyes on the interesting sight before me. It was bright
       moonlight, as clear as I need wish, and within one night of
       being full moon. There were six large lions, about twelve or
       fifteen hyenas, and from twenty to thirty jackals, feasting
       on and around the carcases of the three rhinoceroses. The
       lions feasted peacefully, but the hyenas and jackals fought
       over every mouthful, and chased one another round and round
       the carcases, growling, laughing, screeching, chattering,
       and howling without any intermission. The hyenas did not
       seem afraid of the lions, although they always gave way
       before them; for I observed that they followed them in the
       most disrespectful manner, and stood laughing, one or two on
       either side, when any lions came after their comrades to
       examine pieces of skin or bones which they were dragging
       away. I had lain watching this banquet for about three
       hours, in the strong hope that, when the lions had feasted,
       they would come and drink. Two black and two white
       rhinoceroses had made their appearance, but, scared by the
       smell of the blood, they had made off. At length the lions
       seemed satisfied. They all walked about with their heads up,
       and seemed to be thinking about the water; and in two
       minutes one of them turned his face toward me, and came on;
       he was immediately followed by a second lion, and in half a
       minute by the remaining four. It was a decided and general
       move, they were all coming to drink right bang in my face,
       within fifteen yards of me."</p>

    <p>The hunters were presently discovered. "An old lioness, who
    seemed to take the lead, had detected me, and, with her head
    high and her eyes fixed full upon me she was coming slowly
    round the corner of the little vley to cultivate further my
    acquaintance! This unfortunate coincidence put a stop at once
    to all further contemplation. I thought; in my haste, that it
    was perhaps most prudent to shoot this lioness, especially as
    none of the others had noticed me. I accordingly moved my arm
    and covered her; she saw me move and halted, exposing a full
    broadside. I fired; the ball entered one shoulder, and passed
    out behind the other. She bounded forward with repeated growls,
    and was followed by her five comrades all enveloped in a cloud
    of dust; nor did they atop until they had reached the cover
    behind me, except one old gentleman, who halted and looked back
    for a few seconds, when I fired, but the ball went high. I
    listened anxiously for some sound to denote the approaching end
    of the lioness; nor listened in vain. I heard her growling and
    stationary, as if dying. In one minute her comrades crossed the
    vley a little below me, and made toward the rhinoceros. I then
    slipped Wolf and Boxer on her scent, and, following them into
    the cover, I found her lying dead."</p>

    <p>Mr. Cumming's adventures with elephants are no less
    thrilling. He had selected for the aim of his murderous rifle
    two huge female elephants from a herd. "Two of the troop had
    walked slowly past at about sixty yards, and the one which I
    had selected was feeding with two others on a thorny tree
    before me. My hand was now as steady as the rock on which it
    rested, so, taking a deliberate aim, I let fly at her head, a
    little behind the eye. She got it hard and sharp, just where I
    aimed, but it did not seem to affect her much. Uttering a loud
    cry, she wheeled about, when I gave her the second ball, close
    behind the shoulder. All the elephants uttered a strange
    rumbling noise, and made off in a line to the northward at a
    brisk ambling pace, their huge fanlike ears flapping in the
    ratio of their speed. I did not wait to load, but ran back to
    the hillock to obtain a view. On gaining its summit, the guides
    pointed out the elephants; they were standing in a grove of
    shady trees, but the wounded one was some distance behind with
    another elephant, doubtless its particular friend, who was
    endeavoring to assist it. These elephants had probably never
    before heard the report of a gun; and having neither seen nor
    smelt me, they were unaware of the presence of man, and did not
    seem inclined to go any further. Presently my men hove in
    sight, bringing the dogs; and when these came up, I waited some
    time before commencing the attack, that the dogs and horses
    might recover their wind. We then rode slowly toward the
    elephants, and had advanced within two hundred yards of them,
    when, the ground being open, they observed us, and made off in
    an easterly direction; but the wounded one immediately dropped
    astern, and next moment she was surrounded by the dogs, which,
    barking angrily, seemed to engross her attention. Having placed
    myself between her and the retreating troop, I dismounted to
    fire, within forty yards of her, in open ground. Colesberg was
    extremely afraid of the elephants, and gave me much trouble,
    jerking my arm when I tried to fire. At length I let fly; but,
    on endeavoring to regain my saddle. Colesberg declined to allow
    me to mount; and when I tried to lead him, and run for it, he
    only backed toward the wounded elephant. At this moment I heard
    another elephant close behind: and on looking about I beheld
    the 'friend,' with uplifted trunk, charging down upon me at top
    speed, shrilly trumpeting, and following an old black pointer
    named Schwart, that was perfectly deaf, and trotted along
    before the enraged elephant quite unaware of what was behind
    him. I felt certain that she would have either me or my horse.
    I, however, determined not to relinquish my steed, but to hold
    on by the bridle. My men, who of course kept at a safe
    distance, stood aghast with their mouths open, and for a few
    seconds my position was certainly not an enviable one.
    Fortunately, however, the dogs took off the attention of the
    elephants; and, just us they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page221"
       id="page221"></a>[pg 221]</span> were upon me I managed to
       spring into the saddle, where I was safe. As I turned my
       back to mount, the elephants were so very near, that I
       really expected to feel one of their trunks lay hold of me.
       I rode up to Kleinboy for my double-barrelled two-grooved
       rifle; he and Isaac were pale and almost speechless with
       fright. Returning to the charge, I was soon once more
       alongside, and, firing from the saddle, I sent another brace
       of bullets into the wounded elephant. Colesberg was
       extremely unsteady, and destroyed the correctness of my aim.
       The 'friend' now seemed resolved to do some mischief, and
       charged me furiously, pursuing me to a distance of several
       hundred yards. I therefore deemed it proper to give her a
       gentle hint to act less officiously, and so, having loaded,
       I approached within thirty yards, and gave it her sharp,
       right and left, behind the shoulder; upon which she at once
       made off with drooping trunk, evidently with a mortal wound.
       Two more shots finished her; on receiving them she tossed
       her trunk up and down two or three times, and falling on her
       broadside against a thorny tree, which yielded like grass
       before her enormous weight, she uttered a deep hoarse cry
       and expired."</p>

    <p>Mr. Cumming's exploits in the water are no less exciting
    than his land adventures. Here is an account of his victory
    over a hippopotamus, on the banks of the Limpopo river, near
    the northernmost extremity of his journeyings.</p>

    <p>"There were four of them, three cows and an old bull; they
    stood in the middle of the river, and though alarmed, did not
    appear aware of the extent of the impending danger. I took the
    sea-cow next me, and with my first ball I gave her a mortal
    wound, knocking loose a great plate on the top of her skull.
    She at once commenced plunging round and round, and then
    occasionally remained still, sitting for a few minutes on the
    same spot. On hearing the report of my rifle two of the others
    took up stream, and the fourth dashed down the river; they
    trotted along, like oxen, at a smart pace as long as the water
    was shallow. I was now in a state of very great anxiety about
    my wounded sea-cow, for I feared that she would get down into
    deep water, and be lost like the last one; her struggles were
    still carrying her down stream, and the water was becoming
    deeper. To settle the matter I accordingly fired a second shot
    from the bank, which, entering the roof of her skull, passed
    out through her eye; she then, kept continually splashing round
    and round in a circle in the middle of the river. I had great
    fears of the crocodiles, and I did not know that the sea-cow
    might not attack me. My anxiety to secure her, however,
    overcame all hesitation; so, divesting myself of my leathers,
    and armed with a sharp knife. I dashed into the water, which at
    first took me up to my arm-pits, but in the middle was
    shallower. As I approached Behemoth her eye looked very wicked.
    I halted for a moment, ready to dive under the water if she
    attacked me, but she was stunned, and did not know what she was
    doing; so, running in upon her, and seizing her short tail, I
    attempted to incline her course to land. It was extraordinary
    what enormous strength she still had in the water. I could not
    guide her in the slightest, and she continued to splash, and
    plunge, and blow, and make her circular course, carrying me
    along with her as if I was a fly on her tail. Finding her tail
    gave me but a poor hold, as the only means of securing my prey,
    I took out my knife, and cutting two deep parallel incisions
    through the skin on her rump, and lifting this skin from the
    flesh, so that I could get in my two hands, I made use of this
    as a handle; and after some desperate hard work, sometimes
    pushing and sometimes pulling, the sea-cow continuing her
    circular course all the time and I holding on at her rump like
    grim Death, eventually I succeeded in bringing this gigantic
    and most powerful animal to the bank. Here the Bushman, quickly
    brought me a stout buffalo-rheim from my horse's neck, which I
    passed through the opening in the thick skin, and moored
    Behemoth to a tree. I then took my rifle, and sent a ball
    through the center of her head, and she was numbered with the
    dead." There is nothing in "Waterton's Wanderings," or in the
    "Adventures of Baron Munchausen" more startling than this
    "Waltz with a Hippopotamus!"</p>

    <p>In the all-wise disposition of events, it is perhaps
    ordained that wild animals should be subdued by man to his use
    at the expense of such tortures as those described in the work
    before us. Mere amusement, therefore, is too light a motive for
    dealing such wounds and death Mr. Cumming owns to; but he had
    other motives,&mdash;besides a considerable profit he has
    reaped in trophies, ivory, fur, &amp;c., he has made in his
    book some valuable contributions to the natural history of the
    animals he wounded and slew.</p>

    <h3>LEDRU ROLLIN.</h3>

    <p>Ledru Rollin is now in his forty-fourth or forty-fifth year,
    having been born in 1806 or 1807. He is the grandson of the
    famous <i>Prestidigateur</i>, or Conjurer Comus, who, about
    four or five-and-forty years ago, was in the acme of his fame.
    During the Consulate, and a considerable portion of the Empire,
    Comus traveled from one department of France to the other, and
    is even known to have extended his journeys beyond the Rhine
    and the Moselle on one side, and beyond the Rhône and Garonne
    on the other. Of all the conjurers of his day he was the most
    famous and the most successful, always, of course, excepting
    that Corsican conjurer who ruled for so many years the
    destinies of France. From those who have seen that famous
    trickster, we have learned that the Charleses, the Alexanders,
    even the Robert Houdins, were children compared with the
    magical wonder-worker of the past generation. The fame of Comus
    was enormous, and his gains proportionate; and when he had
    shuffled off this mortal coil it was found he had left to his
    descendants a very ample&mdash;indeed, for France, a very large
    fortune. Of the descendants in a right line, his grandson,
    Ledru Rollin, was his favorite, and to him the old man left the
    bulk of his fortune, which, during the minority of Ledru
    Rollin, grew to a sum amounting to nearly, if not fully, £4,000
    per annum.</p>

    <p>The scholastic education of the young man who was to inherit
    this considerable fortune, was nearly completed during the
    reign of Louis XVIII., and shortly after Charles X. ascended
    the throne <i>il commençait à faire sur droit</i>, as they
    phrase it in the <i>pays Latin</i>. Neither during the reign of
    Louis XVIII., nor indeed now, unless in the exact and physical
    sciences, does Paris afford a very solid and substantial
    education. Though the Roman poets and historians are tolerably
    well studied and taught, yet little attention is paid to Greek
    literature. The physical and exact sciences are unquestionably
    admirably taught at the Polytechnique and other schools; but
    neither at the College of St. Barbe, nor of Henry IV., can a
    pupil be so well grounded in the rudiments and humanities as in
    our grammar and public schools. A studious, pains-taking, and
    docile youth, will, no doubt, learn a great deal, no matter
    where he has been placed in pupilage; but we have heard from a
    contemporary of M. Rollin, that he was not particularly
    distinguished either for his industry or his docility in early
    life. The earliest days of the reign of Charles X. saw M. Ledru
    Rollin an <i>étudiant en droit</i> in Paris. Though the schools
    of law had been re-established during the Consulate pretty much
    after the fashion in which they existed in the time of Louis
    the XIV., yet the application of the <i>alumni</i> was fitful
    and desultory, and perhaps there were no two
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page223"
       id="page223"></a>[pg 223]</span> classes in France, at the
       commencement of 1825. who were more imbued with the
       Voltarian philosophy and the doctrines and principles of
       Rousseau, than the <i>élèves</i> of the schools of law and
       medicine.</p>

    <p>Under a king so sceptical and voluptuous, so much of a
    <i>philosophie</i> and <i>phyrronéste</i>, as Louis XVIII.,
    such tendencies were likely to spread themselves through all
    ranks of society&mdash;to permeate from the very highest to the
    very lowest classes: and not all the lately acquired asceticism
    of the monarch, his successor, nor all the efforts of the
    Jesuits could restrain or control the tendencies of the
    <i>étudiants en droit</i>. What the law-students were
    antecedently and subsequent to 1825, we know from the
    <i>Physiologie de l'Homme de Loi</i>; and it is not to be
    supposed that M. Ledru Rollin, with more ample pecuniary means
    at command, very much differed from his fellows. After
    undergoing a three years' course of study, M. Rollin obtained a
    diploma as a <i>licencié en droit</i>, and commenced his career
    as <i>stagiare</i> somewhere about the end of 1826 or the
    beginning of 1827. Toward the close of 1829, or in the first
    months of 1830, he was, we believe, placed on the roll of
    advocates; so that he was called to the bar, or, as they say in
    France, received an advocate, in his twenty-second or
    twenty-third year.</p>

    <p>The first years of an advocate, even in France, are
    generally passed in as enforced an idleness as in England.
    Clients come not to consult the greenhorn of the last term; nor
    does any <i>avoué</i> among our neighbors, any more than any
    attorney among ourselves, fancy that an old head is to be found
    on young shoulders. The years 1830 and 1831 were not marked by
    any oratorical effort of the author of the <i>Decline of
    England</i>; nor was it till 1832 that, being then one of the
    youngest of the bar of Paris, he prepared and signed an opinion
    against the placing of Paris in a state of siege consequent on
    the insurrections of June. Two years after he prepared a
    memoir; or <i>factum</i>, on the affair of the Rue Transonain,
    and defended Dupoty, accused of <i>complicité morale</i>, a
    monstrous doctrine invented by the Attorney-General Hebert.
    From 1834 to 1841 he appeared as counsel in nearly all the
    cases of <i>émeute</i> or conspiracy where the individuals
    prosecuted were Republicans, or <i>quasi</i>-Republicans.
    Meanwhile, he had become the proprietor and <i>rédacteur en
    chef</i> of the <i>Reforme</i> newspaper, a political journal
    of an ultra-Liberal&mdash;indeed of a
    Republican&mdash;complexion, which was then called of extreme
    opinions, as he had previously been editor of a legal newspaper
    called <i>Journal du Palais</i>. <i>La Reforme</i> had been
    originally conducted by Godefroy Cavaignac, the brother of the
    general, who continued editor till the period of the fatal
    illness which preceded his death. The defense of Dupoty, tried
    and sentenced under the ministry of Thiers to five years'
    imprisonment, as a regicide, because a letter was found open in
    the letter-box of the paper of which he was editor, addressed
    to him by a man said to be implicated in the conspiracy of
    Quenisset, naturally brought M. Rollin into contact with many
    of the writers in <i>La Reforme</i>; and these persons, among
    others Guinard Arago, Etienne Arago, and Flocon, induced him to
    embark some portion of his fortune in the paper. From one step
    he was led on to another, and ultimately became one of the
    chief&mdash;indeed, if not the chief proprietor. The
    speculation was far from successful in a pecuniary sense, but
    M. Rollin, in furtherance of his opinions, continued for some
    years to disburse considerable sums in the support of the
    journal. By this he no doubt increased his popularity and his
    credit with the Republican party, but it cannot be denied that
    he very materially injured his private fortune. In the earlier
    portion of his career, M. Rollin was, it is known, not
    indisposed to seek a seat in the Chamber, under the auspices of
    M. Barrot, but subsequently to his connection with the
    <i>Reforme</i>, he had himself become thoroughly known to the
    extreme party in the departments, and on the death of Gamier
    Pagès the elder, was elected in 1841 for Le Mans, in La
    Sarthe.</p>

    <p>In addressing the electors, after his return, M. Rollin
    delivered a speech much more Republican than Monarchical. For
    this he was sentenced to four months' imprisonment, but the
    sentence was appealed against and annulled on a technical
    ground, and the honorable member was ultimately acquitted by
    the Cour d'Assizes of Angers.</p>

    <p>The parliamentary <i>début</i> of M. Rollin took place in
    1842. His first speech was delivered on the subject of the
    secret-service money. The elocution was easy and flowing, the
    manner oratorical, the style somewhat turgid and bombastic. But
    in the course of the session M. Rollin improved, and his
    discourse on the modification of the criminal law, on other
    legal subjects, and on railways, were more sober specimens of
    style. In 1843 and 1844 M. Rollin frequently spoke; but though
    his speeches were a good deal talked of outside the walls of
    the Chamber, they produced little effect within it.
    Nevertheless, it was plain to every candid observer that he
    possessed many of the requisites of the orator&mdash;a good
    voice, a copious flow of words, considerable energy and
    enthusiasm, a sanguine temperament and jovial and generous
    disposition. In the sessions of 1845-46, M. Rollin took a still
    more prominent part. His purse, his house in the Rue Tournon,
    his counsels and advice, were all placed at the service of the
    men of the movement; and by the beginning of 1847 he seemed to
    be acknowledged by the extreme party as its most conspicuous
    and popular member. Such indeed was his position when the
    electoral reform banquets, on a large scale, began to take
    place in the autumn of 1847. These banquets, promoted and
    forwarded by the principal members of the opposition to serve
    the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page224"
       id="page224"></a>[pg 224]</span> cause of electoral reform,
       were looked on by M. Rollin and his friends in another
       light. While Odillon Barrot, Duvergier d'Haurunne, and
       others, sought by means of them to produce an enlarged
       constituency, the member for Sarthe looked not merely to
       functional, but to organic reform&mdash;not merely to an
       enlargement of the constituency, but to a change in the form
       of the government. The desire of Barrot was <i>à la vérité à
       la sincerité des institutions conquises en Juillet</i> 1830;
       whereas the desire of Rollin was, <i>à l'amélioration des
       classes laborieuses</i>; the one was willing to go on with
       the dynasty of Louis Philippe and the Constitution of July
       improved by diffusion and extension of the franchise, the
       other looked to a democratic and social republic. The result
       is now known. It is not here our purpose to go over the
       events of the Revolution of February 1848, but we may be
       permitted to observe, that the combinations by which that
       event was effected were ramified and extensive, and were
       long silently and secretly in motion.</p>

    <p>The personal history of M. Rollin, since February 1848, is
    well-known and patent to all the world. He was the <i>ame
    damnée</i> of the Provisional Government&mdash;the man whose
    extreme opinions, intemperate circulars, and vehement patronage
    of persons professing the political creed of
    Robespierre&mdash;indisposed all moderate men to rally around
    the new system. It was in covering Ledru Rollin with the shield
    of his popularity that Lamartine lost his own, and that he
    ceased to be the political idol of a people of whom he must
    ever be regarded as one of the literary glories and
    illustrations. On the dissolution of the Provisional
    Government, Ledru Rollin constituted himself one of the leaders
    of the movement party. In ready powers of speech and in
    popularity no man stood higher; but he did not possess the
    power of restraining his followers or of holding them in hand,
    and the result was, that instead of being their leader he
    became their instrument. Fond of applause, ambitious of
    distinction, timid by nature, destitute of pluck, and of that
    rarer virtue moral courage, Ledru Rollin, to avoid the
    imputation of faint-heartedness, put himself in the foreground,
    but the measures of his followers being ill-taken, the plot in
    which he was mixed up egregiously failed, and he is now in
    consequence an exile in England.</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>GENERAL GARIBALDI.</h3>

    <p>MR. FILIPANTE gives the following notice of this Italian
    revolutionary leader in a communication to the <i>Evening
    Post</i>. "His exertions in behalf of the liberal movement in
    Italy have been indefatigable. As active as he was courageous,
    he was among the first to take up arms against Austrian
    tyranny, and the last to lay them down. Even when the
    triumvirate at Rome had been overthrown, and the most ardent
    spirits despaired of the republic, Garibaldi and his noble band
    of soldiers refused to yield; they maintained a vigorous
    resistance to the last, and only quitted the ground when the
    cause was so far gone that their own success would have been of
    no general advantage.</p>

    <p>"The General is about forty years of age. He was in early
    life an officer in the Sardinian service, but, engaging in an
    unsuccessful revolt against the government of Charles Albert,
    he was compelled to leave his native land. He fled to
    Montevideo, where he fought with distinction in the wars
    against Rosas. At the breaking out of the late revolution he
    returned. His military capacities being well known, he was
    entrusted with a command; and throughout the war his services
    were most efficient. He defeated the allied troops of Austria,
    France, and Naples, in several battles; his name, in fact,
    became a terror, and when the republic fell, and he was
    compelled to retire to the Appenines, the invaders felt that
    his return would be more formidable than any other event.</p>

    <p>"From Italy he went to Morocco, where he has since lived.
    But his friends, desiring that his great energies should be
    actively employed, have offered him the command of a merchant
    ship, which he has accepted. He will, therefore, hereafter be
    engaged in the peaceful pursuits of commerce, unless his
    country should again require his exertions."</p>
    <hr />

    <h3>CRIME, IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE.</h3>

    <p>In recent discussions of the effects of education upon
    morals, the relative conditions of Great Britain and France in
    this respect have often been referred to. The following
    paragraph shows that the statistics in the case have not been
    well understood:</p>

    <p>"In a recent sitting of the Academy of Moral and Political
    Sciences, M. Leon Faucher, the representative, read a paper on
    the state of crime in England; and some of the journals have
    taken advantage of this to institute a comparison with returns
    of the criminality of France, recently published by the
    Government&mdash;the result being anything but flattering to
    England. But M. Faucher, the Academy, the newspapers, and
    almost everybody else in France, seems to be entirely ignorant
    that it is impossible to institute a comparison between the
    amount of crime in England and the amount of crime in France,
    inasmuch as crimes are not the same in both countries. Thus,
    for example, it is a felony in England to steal a pair of
    shoes, the offender is sent before the Court of Assize, and his
    offense counts in the official returns as a "crime;" in France,
    on the contrary, a petty theft is considered a <i>délit</i>, or
    simple offense, is punished by a police magistrate, and figures
    in the returns as an "offense." With respect to murders, too,
    the English have only two general names for
    killing&mdash;murder or manslaughter&mdash;but the French have
    nearly a dozen categories of killing, of which what the English
    call murder forms only one. It is the same, in short, with
    almost every species of crime."</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
